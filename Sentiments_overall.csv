1,2007,ford,edge,6.3,3.7,101,60,"* i have enormous problem with the transmissionWhat a difference from my orginal 06 Ford Escape Hybrid to a 07 Ford Edge, Ride is excellent and power is great, could have tuned engine better for better gas mileage, but I will give up the 3 or 4 miles over my Escape, Hybrid.
* Very nice all around vehicle!This CUV is excellent looking, and very nice, we got the car and loved it, we had an Expedition before so we decide to go for better gas mileage.
* At first, my friends said I bought a ""chick car"", but after riding in it, they figured out that it's quite ""gender neutral"".This is a great vehicle.
* Two of my golfing buddies drive the Lexus RX 330 and both say their next car will be the Edge.The AWD Edge has been a great car to drive.
"
2,2007,volkswagen,rabbit,5.5,3.6,74,61,"* It doesn't get the gas mileage stated but I was also told that it would take a few thousand miles for the engine to break in and then I would get the good gas mileage.
* My Rabbit is fun to drive and so far has been very reliable.Gas mileage isn't as good as my 96 but the power is much better.
* 'Nuff said.I traded in a 2000 Golf for my new Rabbit, and although I technically ""downsized"" since I went from a ""fully-loaded"" Golf GLS to a ""base-model"" Rabbit, I do not feel like I am missing anything (except the sunroof, but oh well).
* I would love to sell these for a living.I purchased the Rabbit a week ago, and am enjoying the well-designed interior and great drive very much.
"
3,2007,volvo,xc90,7.3,3.8,44,16,"* It's a very easy SUV to drive !This is a great car....tons of power with new six speed auto....luxurious interior and easy to use navi....drives like a solid tank and you are unstoppable...active headlights are great at night....overall a great car and better than X5, Q7 and ML350I recently bought an 2007 Volvo XC90 with the 3.2 6 cylinder motor.
* Less expensive, better safety rating, better 3rd row seat configuration than Lexus  better interior features/finish and seemed more solid vehicle than MDX.
* If you are looking for an SUV with good gas mileage 19 MPG, all the safety and luxury features you will ever need, this is the car for you.this car is probably the best vehicle I have owned.
* And, it does so perfectly with its capacity for 7 passengers, plush and comfortable interior, all wheel drive, built in booster seat (gotta love it), safety features that Volvo is known for, decent mpg, and first class looks for a night out on the town.
"
4,2007,jeep,compass,5.7,3.6,59,45,"* No problems with my Jeep have over 65,000 miles on it on and off road very versatile...... Jeep has done it and I am proud to say I am happy with my vehicleWe looked at both US and import small SUV's and bought Compass based on vehicle cost and availability of CVT.
* SMILES) However, it is still a great car and I am having a WONDERFUL time with it....so far.I bought the Jeep Compass because I had heard it was a great little SUV along with great reliability....I was very wrong!!
* I was a little hesitant to but one but I have always been a Dodge fan so I figured Jeep has been around for a while and got my compass I am very very satisfied more so than any other vehicle I have owned and I have owned about 15 so the compass has by far exceeded my expectations on long trips and just for fun even with the family and my mother who only likes Cadillac she loves my compass and is thinking of buying one I will be a repeat Jeep customer.
* Fun!Although the Compass is a Consumer's Digest ""Best Buy"" and an Edmund's Lowest Cost to own vehicle, auto magazine critics and Jeep traditionalists have not had many nice things to say about the Compass, which almost swayed me from purchasing a new Compass.
"
5,2007,chrysler,sebring,4.9,3.3,27,28,"* don't drive it like you stole it and service it and it shouldn't.
* We're expecting great service out of this car like our old LHS, +100k and no troublesA Sebring wasn't even on my next car list several years ago but the redesigned 2007 changed all that.
* Especially considering from the back it looks like an Audi and the side it looks like a BMWThis is simply a beautiful car, inside and out.
* There isn't much leg room in the back seating area and the sound system wasn't as good as I thought it would be.
"
6,2007,gmc,yukon_xl,5.5,3.6,28,23,"* The vehicle is loaded with luxury options such as heated front and rear seats, IPOD capability, heated steering wheel, navigation, satellite radio, leather, wood grain accents, reareview camera and sensors, remote start, sunroof, 20 inch chrome rims, running boards and a Bose stereo system.Compared to a Cadillac Escalade ESV and you will be paying $10000 or more just for the Cadillac name.The Engine is responsive and supplies plenty of power for cargo and several passengers.The suspension and ride is superb and comfortable.The 07 GMC Yukon Denali is an excellent vehicle for those who seek comfort and style.I pull a 26foot trailer and when it comes to a hill you think your in a 4 cylinder.
* The extra space in the rear is great for the travel luggage of 5 people.Bumper cracked from end to end after backing out of driveway over small mound of snow was told by owner of body shop that it wasn't our fault it was the fault of poor design of front bumper, will always have this concern because front bumper acts like a huge scoop that allows accumulation and eventual breaking of 2 clips which are currently backordered more than likely they are in demand because of all the bumper repairs was told to strongly pursue issue because of possible chronic replacements GM will not assist unless brought to GM dealership at our expense for evaluation Will they risk alerting the customer of this design fault, we think not WILL PURSUE THIS WITH ALL WE'VE GOT!
* I didn't expect great mileage and that expectation was fullfilled.We just upgraded from our '05 Yukon to the '07 Yukon XL (due to a new arrival in the family).
* When the snow melts on the roof it runs down between the door pillars and drops out the bottom and freezes on the running board, keeping the door from opening, or rubbing.We were actually looking to buy the Yukon XL 1500 with leather seats and rear dvd because we needed the extra room for our growing family.
"
7,2007,acura,tl,5.0,3.6,75,76,"* I just upgraded my 2005 Acura TL for the 2007 Acura TL Type S and was very surprised on the way it handled and looked.
* Only concern is the mpg which should get better with added miles.Decided to buy a 07 Acura TL type S instead of Lexus IS350 and BMW 330i and love it.
* I test drove the new G35, and well the Acura can't quite beat the Infiniti as far as straight off the line power, however, when it comes to the complete package for the money, nothing beats the Type-S. Test drove the BMW 3 series, Mercedes C-class, Infiniti, Lexus, and Acura.
* Love my Acura(s)!Went from a 2004 BMW 330i 6M to the new TL Type-S 6M, and I love it!
"
8,2007,volvo,s60,7.6,3.8,22,7,"* I have owned Audi 6 and Lincloln LS prior to this and have found the Volvo to be: more comfortable, better pick-up, interior design to be well built and the leather sport seats are most comfortable of any car ever driven  the exterior lines rival the Audi A 6!
* The R *has* vented brake rotors, the gas cap is on the side of the car away from traffic so it's not ""wrong,"" there *is* a 6 CD changer option, turn the radio off for ""mute"" (duh), the key fob opens the trunk if you press the trunk button *twice* like it says in the manual (bad design, but it's right there in the book), and if you unlock the doors the trunk opens with the touch of a button.I've had my R for about 6 months and couldn't be happier.
* seems to place passenger at an angle within the car.Came across the S60 in Consumer Reports' ""best used cars""  they rate the 07 S60 reliability higher than Infiniti G35(!).
* Great solid build quality, nice amenities, front seats *very* comfortable  rear are as well but a bit cramped for tall folks, look @ S80 if you need more room.
"
9,2007,pontiac,solstice,5.8,3.5,42,30,"* This car is fun fun fun pontiac i am 60 years old but when in my gxp all i can think about is zero to 60. don't let your corvette owners drive this one- you will never be able to produce enough This car is fun to drive!!
* The good news is this rides like a much bigger car, and is more fun to drive than the Miata.After 900 miles on the Solstice, it is a fantastic driver.
* I've done some minor changes but nothing major.Love my new Solstice It is wonderful little a car with comfort & great gas mileageThis is a really fun car to drive.
* On the road, driving verymoderately, the car gets about 25 MPG tops at 60 MPH.The Solstice GXP is a great small run around have fun ride.
"
10,2007,honda,cr-v,5.7,3.5,171,128,"* I will never buy another Honda car and will never recommend it to any of my friends again.Less than 10,000 miles I had to to have the rear differential worked on twice, had to replace tire pressure and master tire pressure sensors at this time, the back Windows squeak like finger nails on a chark board when rolling down, the rear hatch has to be slammed shut, causing the plastic cover above the license plate to fall off, the brakes didn't even last up to 20,000 miles, I am now on my second set of pads, I can not drive at a steady speed between the shifts of the because the car vibrates, sensor that has controls the cooling fan had to be replaced, the plastic splash gaurd under to car came apart, the drivers seat is already wearing down, sad to say but I hate to drive this car - don't buy one.I traded my 2001 for this, and the change is like night and day  the new model is much less truck-y looking and feeling, and has a much quieter more car-like ride.
* The only two things I do not like is the rear visibility (for short people) and the missing cup holder in the dash, otherwise it handles much more like a luxury car, quiet, responsive, much more power and the look and feel of a much more expensive car.Just had the vehicle over a week, and now I enjoy driving to work, its a wonderful commute car, comfortable, quiet, smooth ride, excellent brakes, enough power to go effortlessly in and out of traffic, the vehicle is responsive and feels tight (well built), it takes road bumps and potholes such that the driver is always in control of the steering, so far I've gotten just under 30mpg using premium gas, about 24 using mid range gas.
* With Honda's reliability, resale value and the car's gas mileage I don't think I could have made a better choice.We decided to replace our 2002 CRV LX 2wd after 65,000 trouble free miles with the 2007 CRV EXL AWD.
* This is the 6th Honda I have owned since 1985.I purchased this one in dec 2005.This is by far the most fun to drive and has the looks to kill for.I would recommend the 2007 CRV to anyone who would love to have a sporty fun to drive SUV with all the bells and whistles.
"
11,2007,hyundai,elantra,5.7,3.6,69,52,"* This is my second Hyundai, and I'm pleased with both of them.It is exactly what I wanted in an compact car - 1) Decent overall performance 2) Small enough to fit most San Francisco parking spaces 3) Roomier than my previous compact 4) Loads of features and refinements to make me feel that I was NOT making any compromises in buying a sub-$20k car 5) Killer price (especially with the rebate I got) 6) Very good gas mileage 7) Anticipated reliability as good as Toyota (very important) This doesn't get as good gas mileage as a Prius (heck it doesn't even get its own stated EPA city MPG of 28) but it is at least low emission PZEV.
* My benz has a power sunroof, so does my new Elantra, My benz has heated seats, so does my new Elantra, My benz has leather interior, so does my new Elantra, My benz is roomy enough for 5 people, so is my Elantra.
* The corolla is so outdated, the civic is great but honda dealers are way too proud of this overpriced car (as they don't like to come off sticker), the mazda is a good price but you still get so much more with the elantra.
* I have owned a Honda, Acura, Ford, BMW, and now a Hyundai, but I would put the Hyundai at the top of the list because of it's handling, reliability, and gas mileage.After owning many new Hondas including the Civic, I found a replacement for the Civic in my Elantra SE.
"
12,2007,volkswagen,new_beetle,7.4,3.6,23,8,"* It has a great sound system, great air conditioner, great interior, is extremely comfortable, has beautiful new head-lights, the list goes on.I like this car because it is so very comfortable and very attractive.This is my favorite car that I have ever owned!
* While other compacts feel like they are likely to get blown off the road in a high wind, the Beetle tends to clutch the road and hold its own in snow, rain, etc.I sold my red 99 Beetle last summer.
* It is comfortable, easy to get in and out of, smooth in handling, has plenty roomy, and is just plain fun.I just recently traded an underpowered 2.0 5-speed manual Beetle for a 2.5 6-speed automatic Beetle.
* If you're like me, though, then you will love this car just like I do.I traded in my Red '99 for my new Sunflower yellow (GREAT COLOR) '07.
"
13,2007,kia,sportage,5.6,3.7,15,12,"* For example, something as small as the shopping bag hooks in the back are very female-friendly for all those female shoppers out there like myself.I thought I could love this small SUV but after trading in my 06 Trailblazer for it in an effort to get better gas mileage (was only getting 13 mpg in the Trailblazer), I'm sorely disappointed that I'm only getting 18-19 mpg (mostly city driver).
* Kia really has the market on more bang for your buck, friends told me to buy a Honda CR-V but I bought a KIA Sportage and I'm laughing all the way to the bank with the money I saved, the standard up grades on the Sportage you pay for on other SUVs, would highly recomend this to everyone.We purchased our Sportage EX new, has every available option.
* Got a good deal so other people might too.I just bought a used Kia Sportage with 35000 miles .. it sits better and feels better than any of its competition .. i.e.
* After being used to driving an SUV (we had a mini-van prior to that) I don't like the feel of a car, so we test drove the Kia Sportage and the Rav 4.
"
14,2007,suzuki,reno,4.4,3.5,7,9,"* If you are looking for max mpg, look elsewhere, the Reno offers a pretty good package at the current used prices, shop around and get one at trade-in value and you will have a good 1st car or commuter.
* If I could get Suzuki to void my contract, I would and I would never again buy a Suzuki or recommend one to anyone, even my worst enemy.
* The dealer gave me this because the cobalt was a little bit expensive and I have another loan that's why they didn't gave me the Cobalt.
* To bad they they dont make the Reno or forenza anymore I think Suzuki was dumb for recalling them.I recently purchased a 5spd Reno (46K) for a commuter.
"
15,2007,ford,explorer,6.3,3.7,22,13,"* Great stereo, Great Visibility, V6 is sluggish when punched, V8's were great and mileage diff miniscule between the two.
* Gas mileage is also pretty good, we get around 22 mpg which isn 't bad considering that it is an SUV, although there is always room for improvement.I've owned a lot of Fords and this is the worst.
* If you need serious hauling capacity, sweet highway manners, bad-weather & bad road capability, and aren't averse to a little interior luxury, this ride deserves a look.
* The V-6 is fine for me since I don't plan on hauling anything and the ride is nice and smooth, handling is great!
"
16,2007,kia,optima,5.1,3.7,31,30,"* The Optima has more to offer, a better warranty and we have 17,000 miles on our Sorento and it has never been in the shop.Smooth ride, very good handling with more than adequate acceleration (not as fast as others)  great value by any metric but especially features per dollar.Smooth ride and good road feel.
* IT drives like a caddy and I love the car, has never left me stranded and I am not so good about changing the oil and they are made to be able to go 10,000 max if you forget to change the oil like me.I have had my Kia Optima in the shop 3 times for AC problems.
* I have had complete strangers compliment it's styling, I have gotten as much as 40.7 mpg on one trip, and after 31,000 miles it still runs like a Swiss watch.
* It's not worth the money.I have owned seven cars in my life and my Kia Optima is by far the worst car I have ever owned.
"
17,2007,audi,rs4,3.8,3.6,10,16,"* Mileage isn't the car's strongest suit, but in context, given this car's uber performance, it's quite good (about 19 mpg under normal driving conditions).
* It's still a little nose heavy, but compared to the S4, it's really hardly noticeable, and the braking, engine and lateral stability are outstanding.
* Has more power, much better suspension, looks better, feels better, just a better car and yes you pay for it.
* Audi builds a great car, and the RS4 is a total package of performance, quality, and style.It is difficult to find any fault with this extremely well engineered car.
"
18,2007,volvo,s40,7.2,3.8,18,7,"* No, the fit and finish isn't as nice, and the engine isn't as peppy, but it is an amazing car with a less expensive starting piont.We have owned 3 volvos in the past year, 2 s40's and 1 xc90, all purchased new.
* The factory pickup experience was so fun that I may never buy a car any other way.I have 14000, love this car great gas mileage, comfortable, great radio, just a couple of problems, all interior, sun roof shade broken track, mirror loose all being fix under warranty.
* The Volvo is really impressive: great exterior lines, beautiful clean and contemporary interior, and just awesome for it's price.
* The new S40s are like the old S80s.My father purchased this vehicle for me and not only is it a luxury vehicle, it has great gas mileage and it is extremely fun to drive.
"
19,2007,mitsubishi,eclipse,5.7,3.7,29,22,"* Some people don't like this car because it's a V6 and front wheel drive, but it doesn't matter what they think when I'm passing Mustangs with their V8s.
* Overall the Mustang (which was more expensive than the Eclipse) just didn't seem to offer as much value.Well I've had my '07 Eclipse GS for about three months now so I think I have a good enough feel for the pros and cons to rate this car and give it a review.
* It has great looks, it is fun to drive, and it has plenty of power to go arround.Just traded my low mileage 2004 Spyder in on the new one - I now have the Sunset Pearlescence colored GT with the Sportstronic transmission (which lets you drive as an automatic AND/OR a five speed manual transmission).
* I am 61 years old I know I will love my new car as much as my old one.I bought the Eclipse GS model last week and it is a fun to drive car.
"
20,2007,bmw,3_series,5.5,3.4,146,119,"* BMW sold us the car on the wonderful exterior design that makes this car stand out!Interior is much better then the previouse BMW designs, very solid when driving, good HP and handling, it's something I recommend every family to put their kids in, safe from inside.I haven't really had a lot of time to drive this vehicle but it is incredible.
* First problem was brake warning, second times it has same problem.Third time,both rear power windows broken,have to order parts,and then shift warning problem,parts ordered is in back order.This car is just a piece of junks,it is a waste of money and time.Not only that,it is frustrated too.I feel nervous every time hearing alarm warning sound.My car still sitting at dealer now waiting for parts.I will get rid of this BMW car as soon as possible and never BMW againThis is my first BMW car and now I understand why it is called German engineering.
* It's hard to enjoy my ""driver's car"" when my clutch foot is tingling, and I'm being tortured by diabolically illogical controls and wretched ergonomics.I never expected to say that my VW Passat had more attention to detail than the car I've waited so long to own, but my BMW falls short in some areas, including: a less impressive dash display  a headrest that tilts too far forward and can't be adjusted  a trip computer stop watch that must be manually reset for each trip (it auto reset on the VW)  a manual that must be stored in the trunk (the VW had a compartment for it under the steering wheel)  back window controls are situated where I expect the front to be  door lock control is on the dash rather than the driver's door (forces you to get back in the car if you forget to unlock all doors before getting out).After having my car for only 4 months, the seat belt arm broke.
* All around an awesome car!First BMW and I love it - it is a drivers car - hands on - it's so much fun I don't even want to use cruise control.In general I would say that I love the car.
"
21,2007,chevrolet,aveo,6.2,3.6,48,29,"* Additionally, Chevrolet offers a great warranty, which I haven't had to use yet, but it good to know it is available if needed.I have come to love driving it but it lacks acceleration and the miles per gallon are not that great.
* And it would be a good car for the price if you don't care about looks or horse's thanks to the the MPG and dependability factor.
* The adjustments on the driver seat are wonderful, I can drive long distances without feeling fatigued and sore when I arrive.I like my new Aveo, but the gas mileage is not what I expected or was reported.
* Its easy to drive, has great visibility and very good safety features like side impact air bags with good crash test ratings.
"
22,2007,ford,expedition_el,5.5,3.7,17,14,"* The Ford EL Limited has more standard equipment including a wrap around air bag system that protects passengers all the back to the third row.
* This vehicle is comfortable to drive, has great interior features, fits the family and all the gear, and it is an overall great choice for large families.
* Great for towing, never knew I had anything back there.We have 3 kids and decided to go back to a large vehicle.
* Before the purchase, I decided to go to the Ford dealer to see what Ford had engineered with the EL - wow.
"
23,2007,jeep,patriot,6.7,3.6,44,22,"* this car is just bad no power when you step on the gas does not handle well on rain or snow only comes in 5spd no 6spd i feel for this car to be better needs to have 6cylinders with 250horspower i will never buy a jeep patriot again gas tank only takes 12.5gal you need to fil twice a week audio controls in back of steering wheel interior all plastic,buy german I purchased my Patriot Sport 5 days ago and in that time have tested it in brutal cold, icy roads, and blizzard conditions, as well as a 400 mile road trip.
* There is not quite as much room for cargo as I would like in the back, but it's OK. Also, this SUV gets great gas mileage but it has a small tank.
* I am tired of the gas guzzling mamoths on the road this one is good enough for me and economic.I would recomend this vehicle to people looking for something with pretty good storage space and a suprisingly smooth highway rideThe ride is smooth and the seats comfortable.
* Recommend to anyone looking for reliable, great gas mileage, roomy/comfortable, fun to drive, room to haul stuff (with the back seats down), & eye catching compact SUV that get compliments!
"
24,2007,toyota,matrix,5.8,3.6,31,22,"* You won't find a better value in this price range, all things considered.While the gas mileage was a definite plus, the lack of power in this vehicle and the size of other vehicles when driving the Matrix, made me get rid of it.
* More cargo room than any of the other ""wagons"" out there, and it's a cute sporty mom car for the young at heart who aren't ready to graduate to the minivans, but also not willing to suffer the cost of fuel in an SUV!I have only owned my Matrix a week, but it is fantastic!
* This is not a sports car, so don't expect pony car power, its fine especially compared with other 4 bangers.With the gas prices soaring, I decided to trade in my SUV and get something with better gas mileage.
* I have to say it's a great transportation car and the price was just over $13000.00 (new) gas mileage is only twenty -two combine but gets a good 32 mpg on the highway to and from Vegas.
"
25,2007,mercedes-benz,m-class,5.2,3.6,48,44,"* Does anything compare?this is third ML we have purchased two for me one for wife easy acess for srs rear seats easy to raise and lower controls different than earlier models a bit more complicated quality construction throughout recommend rear tv option for stiff neck srs like myself MB service is always superbMy fourth ML, the first three were--simply put--mediocre.
* Does anything compare?this is third ML we have purchased two for me one for wife easy acess for srs rear seats easy to raise and lower controls different than earlier models a bit more complicated quality construction throughout recommend rear tv option for stiff neck srs like myself MB service is always superbMy fourth ML, the first three were--simply put--mediocre.
* If BMW hadn't reduced driver's cabin space length in '07 for the sake of the ridiculously little 3rd row seats, probably would have gone with X5, but I couldn't be happier.I purchased the 2008 ML CDI with Package One last month.
* Here's why: Full time 4 wheel drive with full time traction and stability control, quiet roomy interior, comfortable seats, a bright sunroof and pleasant interior decor, driving feel of a car and not a truck, and an incredible drivetrain.
"
26,2007,dodge,charger,5.8,3.4,42,31,"* Btw, I replaced her vss and tps in the Taurus so I get the charger all the time nowI love the way the charger looks on the outside other than that.The stereo system isn't good, sounds like if you turn it up at all you're going to blow a speaker.
* I can't say enough about this vehicle.have owned 1969 charger {383ci} and a 1973 charger {400ci} 1964 plymouth sport fury {383ci} a 2006 charger 5.7. every one of these were great.
* I feel like I'm king of the road when I'm driving!The Charger is a great looking muscle car like the Mustang, only is suitable for families.
* Love this car ever since I layed eyes on it, fun to drive and everyone wants to drive but too bad, get your own.Ok, I have been a Ford guy most of my life, but when the Dodge Charger came out a few years ago I knew that was the car for me!
"
27,2007,toyota,camry_solara,6.0,3.6,28,19,"* I've owned a variety of automobiles to use as a comparison and can honostly say that I love my Solara convertible and am reminded of that everythime I drive it.My Toyota Solara V6 SLE coupe is a joy to drive with the exception of several rattles and squeaks in the interior.
* Solara convertible is great compared to mustang GT if you don't mind 90 hp less and better than the Pontiac G6 which gives 0 trunk space with top down.
* Friends that drive the car agree that there is something wrong but I can't seem to get Toyota to agree with me.Just the looks of this Solara coupe sold me on the car.
* There's nothing like a Toyota for dependability and style.I purchased this car in lieu of the 4 dr Camry, it's so much sportier.
"
28,2007,chevrolet,tahoe,5.5,3.6,112,90,"* Great truck if looking for an SUVWe bought this vehicle with the belief that it would be a solid vehicle that would meet the rigors of driving in the Colorado high country.
* If I had to complain about anything at all, it would be the 3rd row seats not folding into the floor.This is my second 2007 chevy Tahoe, first bought an LS, then bought an LT3, I love all of the extra features, drives like a dream, and it is great for travel.
* You don't expect to get great fuel economy on a vehicle like this, but I was pleasantly surprised to be getting 19-21 mpg on the highway.
* We do like the way GM replaced stereo system and control knobs with those that will not peel, the remote access options for rear and front, the new way we can adjust the roof rack (easier now), the ease of putting the rear seats down, the new styling, and the navigation/DVD/stereo sytem.
"
29,2007,audi,a3,3.0,3.6,12,28,"* A month of driving the A3 and it's still love!A great car that combines function with fun.
* I drove this car back to back with a Mazdaspeed3 and with the DSG I could drive the A3 faster than the Mazda on the same course.
* Combine this competence with a basic but flawless interior, a great stereo, very good gas mileage and totally solid build quality and I just can't see what Audi could've improved.
* I realize I could have purchased a VW Rabbit/Golf GTI with many of the same qualities and features for far less, but I wanted the more premium features of the Audi, and I prefer its exterior design.The A3 is delightfully deceptive, looking small on the outside but airy and roomy inside and appearing underpowered by a 2 liter engine but providing more get up and go than many larger engines.
"
30,2007,saturn,outlook,5.0,3.5,61,62,"* If you need a truck this size, its good, but be warned - you will get traditional SUV mileage - don't believe GM's lies about its efficiency.I bought my Outlook in April because we were getting ready to have another baby and needed more room.
* I feel that it's alot of car for the money.It's lower to the ground than your larger SUV, so it's easer for disabled and older peopleLooks great, ride is solid, and I love the XM radio!
* It gives a solid, quiet, smooth ride, and drives so much ""smaller"" than its size (i.e., so much like a car) that I felt totally comfortable driving it from my first test drive.
* Without hesitation, I would recommend buying the Saturn Outlook.We drove this new vehicle from Oregon to Missouri and back, puting over 5,200 miles on it and only show 21 MPG.

31,2007,pontiac,grand_prix,5.2,3.5,26,24,"* I got a 2007 Pontiac Grand Prix GT in white with the tan leather interior with only 27,000 miles for a first car (You'd say spoiled brat, but let me just say I got a hell of a deal!).
* and gets great highway mileage.I have 3 Pontiac Grand Prix sedans, 2000, 2003, both silver, and now the black 2007 GT Special Edition.
* Granted, it would be nice if the front passenger seat had the same power options.I have owned the last three versions of the Grand Prix and each one has become more technologically advanced and stylish than the last while build quality and interior design has become progressively inferior.
* My last Grand Prix went 8 years and 160,000 trouble free miles, i hope this does the samne.it goes like this: to have a v8 gxp with all options it's a pleasure to drive anywhere.

32,2007,mitsubishi,outlander,6.2,3.7,90,55,"* Great engine, though inferior quality of interior features - easily scratched panels, no lights for button Windows except 1 -inferior seat cover - brakes are already squeaking at 7 mos old -prone to moisture, my front Windows have weird sound already- I am expecting them not to open anytime- informed dealers already - I am a Mitsubishi person though next time -I think I'll try Honda - my car was shipped from Japan- I noticed my tires are already worn out considering I just I take care of my car very well - I'll change my Yokohama tires in less than 2 years -maybe the u. S. Version is have longer mileage- who knows!Vehicle has all the bells and whistles but does not have any useful features that don't cost much such as 1.
* I been many places using this outlander, it's great car in my opinion this SUV is much more better than Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV.I researched for a mid-size SUV and upon my reviews test drove the Outlander, Nissan xterra, Hyundai Santa Fe, and Honda Pilot.
* I rarely drive the sports car now as this is a better ride and still great fun to drive!I've had my LS 2WD Outlander for one month now and love it so far.
* This car is a great value for the money- great options, safe, reliable, great gas mileage, and not boring!I had a 2004 Outlander and was going to trade it in on a used X5 until I drove the 2007 Outlander.
"
33,2007,cadillac,escalade_esv,7.3,3.4,16,6,"* We are trading it in very soon and hoping for a quieter vehicle with less trouble.i just bought a new esv and i love it its so good to drive and has good comfort the bad part in this car is the sound its so good but it works bose sound system if you are looking for a car this is the one that i highly say yes to :)I'm only 5 feet tall and was scared to purchase this car.
* It drives great, it's not that fun to drive around due to its size but it's really great on trips.The escalade ESV is a great family SUV.
* Keyless remote start wouldn't work, then the heated seats quit, not once but 3 different times, the airconditioner wasn't working, the module for the tire pressure quit working, the heat in the back quit working and more.
* On the bright side, the performance is outstanding, the interior quality is great, and I love all of the features.We bought the 2007 Escalade ESV as a step up from our Durango.
"
34,2007,ford,taurus,6.4,3.7,16,9,"* I would highly recommend the 2007 fleet Taurus to any one looking for a quality car at a great price.I purchased a 2007 Taurus SEL premium, and I've had it for a month, and out of that month its been at Ford for 2 weeks of that month.
* I had a 1998 ford taurus and got almost 200,000 miles on it before I bought my 07 ford taurus.
* Go get one and save ten grand.In Dec of 07 I purchased a used 2007 Ford Taurus from a Ford dealer.
* My wife and I purchased out 2007 Taurus a few weeks ago and are very happy with the purchase.Its a great looking car for a great price.
"
35,2007,kia,spectra,7.0,3.7,33,14,"* I'm glad I got this car.This was one of the smartest purchases I have ever made.Keeping my money in the bank instead of spending more for another car and getting less.It is a good feeling knowing I get a very reliable car,good looks,all the safety features,great gas mileage,and a low price tag.My bank account never looked better,and in this economy that feels great.I just purchased a 2007 Spectra with around 40k miles on it.
* :)Pros: Sporty, roomy, great mileage, comfortable ride, every option you would need, the fit and finish is great.
* Great, Great gas mileage.
* Great gas mileage, car has pep, it's fun to drive.
"
36,2007,nissan,armada,6.2,3.6,15,9,"* 2nd thing is I have no light under the hood.this car is totally amazing... we just bought it and it is amazing, it responds so quickly when you accelerate (compared to the 06 Isuzu Ascender i traded in, which is a GMC ENVOY LOOK-A-LIKE) the armada's style is amazing... the visibility and for me a 6'4ft guy... it makes me feel small which never happens.
* The only thing is this truck does eat gas so know that when you purchase this vehicle, but all SUVs are gas guzzlers.
* The Armada has all you need for an SUV, when I purchased the truck I had to put it to the test, so me and 4 of my buddys took a road trip to south beach miami.
* and the Bose sound system is amazing Good truck for the ladies to go to the store.
"
37,2007,saturn,aura,5.0,3.5,108,108,"* If you can afford the XR, definitely get it, if not, the XE is a great car, and way underpriced for all the you get!Our Aura XR is our fourth Saturn, and shares garage space with an XK-E, TR3, and a '29 Ford hotrod.
* Love, love, love it!It looks like Saturn will have a huge hit on their hands with the new Aura.
* After driving the Saturn Aura and experiencing to ""Saturn Sales Experience"", I knew that I was set to purchase the Aura!
* A friend with a G35 says if she had seen the Saturn she would have saved $7 grand and bought it instead.Once you get over the fact that the Saturn Aura XR is not your typical ""panache"" import (i.e.
"
38,2007,dodge,ram_pickup_2500,4.4,3.4,15,19,"* I feel this is an ongoing issue that may never be resolved on the truck.I use the truck to drive to and from work and to pull trailers on the week-ends.The truck works great for that.I have had my 2007 Dodge 3500 6.7 for a year and 12000 miles and love it.
* Ford diesel scares me due to the notorious problems, and the Chevy's new interior was undesirable, at least to me.
* The Cummins is a great add on  resale and reliability of the diesel makes the extra cost worth it.I feel this truck is solid and very fun to drive.
* As the engine breaks in my gas mileage will just get better and that's important in California when gas is $3.30 but diesel is $3.15.
"
39,2007,chevrolet,trailblazer,4.6,3.6,29,34,"* Other SUV's such as the Pathfinder or 4runner look nice with their shiny futuristic dashboards, however I have ridden in both and the seats are like sitting on a padded ironing board.Great ride in a midsize high- performance SUV.
* rides smooth, seats are comfy, and you can beat Lexus LX 470's and GX 470's all day long, as there are no external V8 identification badges.I think Chevy should have kept this truck in production.
* Overall I'm very happy with the Trailblazer and would highly recommend it to anyone.I just bought my first SUV and I always wanted a Trailblazer, so I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to buy one.
* rides smooth, seats are comfy, and you can beat Lexus LX 470's and GX 470's all day long, as there are no external V8 identification badges.In Sept. 2007, I traded in a Ford Taurus SES for a 3LT Trailblazer with the 5.3L V8.
"
40,2007,ford,mustang,6.0,3.7,84,56,"* Got new, Traded in 96 mustang I bought new Very good car, Very reliable This is the first time I purchased a Mustang and I love her......It is so much fun to drive and take sharp corners.
* It still has many of the negatives too, like poor winter driving qualities, but, old veteran Mustang guy like me have learned to drive these over the years and I for one, have no trouble driving any Mustang in the winter.
* That was a very solid car, but the new model is in a new class, it's a grown-up's car that makes you feel like you're 16.I am totally pleased and surprised by my new 2007 Mustang V6 coupe!
* Very proud to own mustang!Just bought a new Mustang to get back in her good graces after selling the 64 1/2 that was too dangerous for the family.
"
41,2007,gmc,sierra_1500,5.4,3.6,44,37,"* I've owned a '93 Toyota and a '88 GMC, and this new one blows them away with quiet ride, power, great looks, quality, and comfort.
* Handling is great, ride is excellent, good power and getting really good mileage in this reg cab with the 5.3 and AFM even though not broken in yet.
* Debated GMC vs. Toyota for months but went with GMC due to inside/outside looks and GMC mileage better.
* Bravo GMC!I traded in an '04 Silverado Crew Cab for the new GMC Sierra Crew Cab.
"
42,2007,chevrolet,impala,5.5,3.6,85,69,"* Not a gas saver, although it does have flex-fuel management, but that's okay because I love it and I love driving it.I got my Impala used with 32,000 miles and it runs like it has 32 miles.
* I've driven this car for just over 2,000 miles now and the ride and handling are superb, steering feel and response is best of any vehicle I've ever owned, brakes are balanced with great stopping power and pedal feel.Wonderful car, looks good, runs great, nice design and 100 K warranty, what else could a customer ask for?
* But, other than that I love it!Was not expecting this comfortable car to get such great gas mileage...I drive a lot for work, family visits, etc., and I average 27 mpg.
* Otherwise, this is a great engine with lots of torque, the fuel mileage with the VVT can get up to 33mpg on the highway (with the wind at your back...30 otherwise), and the interior is very comfortable.
"
43,2007,hyundai,santa_fe,5.5,3.6,162,133,"* I think Hyundai makes a great product overall--never had a problem with my 2002.test drove rav, crv, and outlander,and decided on the rav,but was dealer shopping for best price on rav,then we saw the santa fe at new car show and did research on this suv, then decided to test drive santa fe .hands down this was best choice,as far as features,price,looks,size,plus 10year powertrain warranty,and hyundai customer service,have always been toyota and honda owners but times have changedWhen my wife and I decided to buy a small SUV as a 3rd vehicle, we first looked at the Hyundai Tucson.
* Overall, this has been a delightful vehicle!This car is the best kept secret in the automotive industry.Absolute impeccable quality inside and out.Its very obvious that Hyundai has done its home work and is producing a mid size suv that will compete with high end name plates in its class.I have just recently purchased my first Korean car and can not say enough abouthow happy I am with the purchase.I am very proud of this vehicle.I purchased a Hyundai for my son 2 years ago and was very impressed with the value of the vehicle.
* And true, the 18"" wheels seem to contribute to a little harsher ride on rough roads.It was very hard to get the Santa Fe optioned as I wanted,I waited 8 months for one as close as poss.Now that I have been driving it almost a year I can say it was worth the wait.Its a fast truck that drives very well and has a controlled ride.The interior is black leather with graphite metallic exterior..Way cool.I have every option but the 3rd row.I looked at Honda,Toyota,Infiniti,Mazda and a few of the over priced premium brands,only to find a vehicle with far to many short comings.Even at 35,000.00 it had way more than they offered...and I saved thousands.I would buy it again only this time with Black int/ Black ext.Its a great truck.When I stated looking for a mid-size SUV, I narrowed down the choices to Rav4, Highlander, and Santa fe.
* Once I saw it I knew it had to be mine.Loved my new Sante fe until I realized the real gas mileage I was getting!Only getting 16 miles per gallon in town,very dissapointed.Says on sticker 19 to 21 in town.And I'm no lead foot.If I had to do it over I would pick something that was much more economical.Big difference in what I was expecting.This is my Wifes car, She was looking for fun to drive yet large enough for 4.. We look at the Santa Fe, Rav4, Murano, X-Terra, Nitro, Sportage, and the CR-V... We learned that a 4 banger was out after the Rav4(there 6 is really nice though) but the CR-V was a nice feel and had get up and go..
"
44,2007,volvo,v70,3.6,3.8,4,7,"* Great gas mileage and a great road trip vehicle for your rides to Grandma's house.
* Wish gas mileage were better, though, but at least it accepts regular gas without harming anything.V2.4L provides enough power for daily use.
* I bought a 2007 V70 closeout which came with lots of options as a replacement for my wife's 940 which was totaled in a wreck -- great deal .
* Great on the open road and mileage has been great city 25 highway 31 MPG.
"
45,2007,subaru,outback,6.2,3.7,37,23,"* But maybe that was good, because I told her I would buy it for that much, and later that day she said I could have it as a gift for helping her select her new Subaru - AKA Miss Suzy!I really don't know what is basic about my BASIC WAGON because it's got all I need and more.
* I do give up some things like having to slowing down on the curves, overall gas mileage (21) can be better and telescoping steer wheel and memory seats would be nice, but, overall, it's a winner.I've had this car for all of 24hrs and LOVE IT!
* Pleasure to own & drive this vehicle.My 2007 Subaru Outback is not a power vehicle, but it has enough power to take off if need be.
* The Subaru had the best ride, best fuel economy, except for hybrids, and good looks too.We just picked up the new Outback and love it.
"
46,2007,nissan,quest,3.0,3.6,16,38,"* The interior was by far the nicest of all the vans and although there wasn't as much storage as the Honda (lazy susan in floor), the fact that no seats had to be removed to have cargo space really helped.Overall I can't imagine being more happy in any other van, but I wouldn't give 10s to anyone, hence the 9s.
* For the price it's an utter failure and can't believe Nissan won't stand by owners problemsThis van is drives like a car.
* Until a redesigned Sienna or Honda Odyssey are available, 07 Quest seemed best!Engine stalls and will leave you stranded, vents don't close so you always smell the outside or get hot/cold feet, sliding door does not close properly because it keeps reversing, many rattles and squeaks, vents in the ceiling keep falling, dealers don't know how to fix things so you keep going back to fix the same thing.
* 7 months after we got it, I called the nav number and they told me I needed to buy a new $280 disc as any addresses newer than 5 years in Houston could not be located, next the tires have gone bald after only 32K miles, Nissan canceled this feature and now we are to pay for all new tires and sensored rims as Michelin or Nissan will come thru.
"
47,2007,mercedes-benz,e-class,5.9,3.6,76,52,"* It's like my dog, always there, and always reliable and friendly 26K miles and in shop only 2x and that was for routine maintenance.I've owned a BMW, a Lexus, a Corvette, two Subaru's, and two prior Mercedes.
* It's like my dog, always there, and always reliable and friendly 26K miles and in shop only 2x and that was for routine maintenance.I've owned a BMW, a Lexus, a Corvette, two Subaru's, and two prior Mercedes.
* After hitting the little wrench icon in the center console, a Mercedes tech guy was out to change the tire within an hour, and since we purchased rim insurance (you have to get that, $800 for 5 years) the tire was covered!I just purchased a brand new 2007 Mercedes Benz E350 Black on Black with the sport package.

"
48,2007,toyota,avalon,5.9,3.6,63,44,"* So far I love my new Avalon in Blue Mirage.Just drove our new Limited Avalon home from an 1000 mile trip and think it's one of the best cars I've ever owned.
* I drive ~20000 miles in a year and need comfortable car, this will do the job.The Avalon is a great car to experience driving comfort.
* Great size, power, interior and ride.Bought the Limited, and was sold on the smooth, almost silent ride, super engine and trans performance, great looks and the luxurious interior.
* Overall, if you are a small woman who is looking for comfort and a great car for road trips, the 2007 Avalon is not it.Just about everything about this car is great, at the price paid it should be.
"
49,2007,lexus,gs_450h,6.0,3.5,12,8,"* We ended up with a car that carries people better than the Accord, performs better than the M3 (really), and gets better gas mileage than either (we get between 26 and 27 mpg).
* I find the car to be a great combination of comfort and performance.My experience with the Lexus GS 450h, although brief, has been overwhelmingly positive, both in terms of performance and mileage.
* It has superior handling and excellent sound system.Love the acceleration and the feeling of driving a ""sports"" car while getting decent gas mileage.
* I love the hybrid, not because I am saving gas money (currently getting 14 mpg, due to my style of driving).
"
50,2007,pontiac,g6,5.1,3.5,94,90,"* I highly recommend to any small family not looking for an SUV.Great car handles great, good power, great design, interior comfortable, transmission shift with precision, easy entryVery fun to drive-(have the coupe with a 6 speed), shifting sometimes is stiff but the car looks great and zips around with very good gas mileage.
* I love my car but this wk found I needed brakes almost ate the rotars out, the brakes made noise from day one and I was told it was dirt, 389.00 later its the brakes, they also found a noice that is a leak in the exhaust but don't know the spot, I have another GMC wiht 85,000 miles and orgnl brakes so its not the driver, I found my garage is the pits, they no longer take you to work(over 5 miles) they will not give me a lender so I am stuck taking a day off with my warrenty still good,,, I have had my G6 for almost two years and I love it!
* i love that it is a hard top, it maykes all the difference, even with the top of it has a ton of room inside back and front and its very stylish fun to drive easy handling good on gas especially on highway.
* Overall, the car is roomy, comfortable, fast, fun, and a good buy!Pricing very fair, good incentives with pontiac, wish there was a classier interior look on dash, good acceleration with slightly bigger engine, like the front grill appearance.I do love this car.
"
51,2007,toyota,camry_hybrid,5.1,3.6,114,109,"* When I first drove this car it felt really big, I have since gotten use to the feel of the car, I realize that it's not as big as I first thought, I also had to get use to the slow take take off from the traffic light, but after driving this vehicle you get use to this and you drive accordingly, also I get very good mileage per gallon, also I like the fact that the car is keyless all in all I like my car it drives excellent it does have speed too.I've had this car for two months, and it's great.
* If you want a car that is comfortable and fun, gives great gas mileage, has room for more than one person, has plenty of power, chose this one.I'm averaging 34 mpg and enjoying all the advantages of Camry reliability and comfortable driving for the model's long life.
* AAA+++I have 2007 Camry Hybrid (standard) for more than two years and have learned how to drive it to get good gas mileage: 45 MPG for a full tank average.
* Great highway mileage(37-42 mpg), less great in city(25-30 mpg).Fun to drive, fully loaded and have had very few problems.
"
52,2007,honda,fit,5.9,3.5,212,146,"* People want to know what it is and how the gas mileage is.I'm 6'8"" and the FIT has more room than any other car or truck I've owned.I've had my Honda Fit Sport automatic just over a month.
* This is a typical Honda product: good-looking, smooth-riding, well-performing, well-built - a terrific value even at the window sticker price.I'm delighted with the interior styling and versatility of the Honda Fit but I've been disappointed with the gas mileage and the dealership's lack of concern.
* Great for our second ""around- town"" car, with capability for hauling items or short duration roadtrips with the family.We looked at the xA, xB, accent, Rio, Spectra, Civic, Sentra, Corolla, and others but after testing the Fit ...no contest... the Fit is far better than the others... its combination of looks, feel, room, features, price, & mileage are unmatched... definitely need to get the Sport... more than worth the extra money... the Civic has less room, less flexibility, less features, and less looks (opinion), all for a couple thou more... only advantage is more power.
* I am sorry I bought mine, it's very peppy and looks racy and cute, but I can't get comfortable with the transmission.This car is fun to drive (in good weather) and gets great mileage, but beware of driving it in the rain or snow.
"
53,2007,dodge,durango,5.0,3.4,14,14,"* Called the dealership & was told it's a design flaw, can't fix, and that at highways speed the passenger compartment fills with turbulent air causing a ""parachute"" like response which lifts the rear of the vehicle making it unstable to drive at highway speeds.
* and the gas cap doesn't make a good seal which makes the service engine light come on when you refuel or get low on fuel.
* Even though there were many choices out there (and we test drove them all) the durango slt had the power (v8), room (3rd row seating), cargo space (when the 3rd row is down), looks (husky - in a good way)& comfort we were looking for.
* Great vehicle, would recommend it to anyone looking for an SUV with seating for up to 8, great power, decent mpg, and fun to drive.We bought the Durango especially for its build inside & out.
"
54,2007,ford,five_hundred,6.2,3.7,38,23,"* I was really suprised at how good this car was after hearing so many terrible things about Ford (and being a GM guy, this is hard to admit) The Ford really is a good daily car.
* Thanks to you owners of 500""s I made a great choice and I look forward to many years of ownership.I purchased a 07 Ford 500 back in June 2007.
* There isn't a lot of 500's in my area but I found one with low mileage and in great shape.
* I love to cruise along at 70 MPH, 2000 RPM and get mileage that hangs around 30 mph...a whole lot better than my Lexus ES300!Took on a trip to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and couldn't ask for a better ride.
"
55,2007,honda,ridgeline,5.0,3.5,54,53,"* And we had to make a trip from Montana to California, the Navigation was great, won't buy another vehicle without it, Everything is great about this vehicle except for the front seats, they are way too hard for long trips, we just couldn't get comfortable(we had to buy cushions to put on the seats)Honda Company should consider putting Acura MDX seats in this truck and make the steering column telescopic.
* It's comfortable handles well, acceleration is more than adequate, has great visibility, and gas mileage is good for a vehicle of this size.
* The in-bed trunk is the best as it is located at the tail gate, the Sport Trac's large in- bed trunk is located behind the rear window so you would have to get up into the bed just to put something in the trunk.
* The Tundra is great, but I selected the Ridgeline because it has a shorter length and thus easier to park, has the all important better safety ratings (5 star vs. 4 star) for driver and roll overs (4 star vs. 3 star), has better mpg, has a locking waterproof trunk, gives a more comfortable ride, and is a welcome departure to the boring look of the age old pickup truck.
"
56,2007,infiniti,m35,5.8,3.6,43,31,"* In the past I have driven an average of over thirty thousand miles per year.I have owened an sts 1998graet car but I buned out the engine in 67,000 miles despite changing the oil every 3000 miles, Bmws are great but do not hold a candle to this Infinty.The closest car in handling to this in my experience was an Alfa Romeo with a DEDION Suspension.Maybe it is current new technolgy.I tried many cars in this class none handled as well, this car is the best car that infiniti ever made ever!
* Now I don't know what to aspire to, since BMW has been producing a technically clunky car lately that doesn't crash test well.UPDATE: Back in March of this year I wrote a review of our M35 AWD and complained about, among other things, the poor gas mileage.
* Great acceleration, great handling great preformance,well rounded car the 2007 infiniti m35x is the best most enjoyable car i have ever owned.
* The bluetooth system is way better than the Maximas, and the voice recognition is pretty accurate, although when calling, its not that great, but whatever.I was looking for a 4door sports car, after test the BMW 5 and Lexus GS, this is the one has everything.
"
57,2007,acura,rl,3.6,3.6,8,14,"* It's not the wheel that's so bad even if it is too slippery, it's that it's loaded with so much stuff it looks like a game controller.
* I owned Porsche and BMW, quality can not compare - great value and better overall perfomance.Truly have fallen in love with this car, because of it's intelligence.
* Exceptional build quality, great performance, just a great vehicle.
* Fuel ecomony is poor, but I don't put on so many miles that it's a factor.I love the car.
"
58,2007,suzuki,grand_vitara,6.4,3.5,27,15,"* All around great car for the money.This vehicle is fun to drive and although it could use better gearing, it does handle very nicely around curves and in the city.
* If it were not for the gas mileage, this would be a great commute vehicle.All in all it's a good vehicle.
* I would recommend this car to anyone.I love the features like Smart Key that you don't find on vehicles in this class.
* But everything else is very good.For what I paid, it is a true bargain.After searching and testing driving so many SUV, I turned into my local Suzuki dealer and took the GV out for a test drive.
"
59,2007,hyundai,tucson,6.6,3.6,42,22,"* I looked at the new Envoys and Yukons and finally the Tucson.Well, as far as price...Tucson won.As far as Warranty...Tucson won.As far as gas mileage...Tucson won...As far as looks...Tucson won... We just bought a brand new '07 Tucson.
* I like the safty features alot especialy the passager air bag and the extra number rear seat belts.what can i say its not to big and not to small its just right for me and my famaly (wich includs 5 ) lol and we all are very very happy with it and its look,value,its power and money savings .My husband got me a great Christmas gift..my Hyundia Tucson,,,,, I love the pick up it has.....very roomy for my husbands long legs, and lot of head room.
* Miss the leather and the 6 cd changer from the Escape, but glad I made the purchase.Really happy with auto!Shopped for a resonably priced small SUV, to replace my wifes aging Cadillac, She wanted to sit higher with better visability, and fuel economy The Tucson fit the need very well, only having it for a short time though- so cannot make a determination as to reliabilty--However it sure is very well appointed, and the build quality is nice--terrific feature set for the bargain mindedI've only owned it for a short time, but it's got me hooked.
* The gas mileage is no better than many MUCH larger SUVs which is also embarrasing.I bought my Tucson with 7 miles on it and 3800 miles later I don't have any complaints.
"
60,2007,toyota,yaris,6.2,3.6,225,137,"* You can't go wrong with anything built by Toyota.I really enjoy my Yaris, I get great gas milage and It is a great car for anyone that doesn't want to pay that much for great qualityI traded in my 2000 echo and im just so happy with my choice the car is great looks good [got mine in nautical blue] every where i go people ask about it i havent got to high 30's in fuel economy but been averaging 33 with ac on in closing i think the car is just what i wantedI love my Yaris.
* It is perfect for me - great gas mileage, fun to drive, great design inside and out, it's a Toyota and on top of all that its affordable.
* If you are looking for a reliable car that gets great mileage and is fun to drive don't pass this car up.The Yaris handles great and has lot of room on the interior.
* The little extras like MP3 hookup are great!I've had my car now for 2 months and I can't believe the great gas mileage I get.

61,2007,hyundai,veracruz,5.7,3.6,63,48,"* My Veracruz is black diamond and saddle interior, and it still is drop dead beautiful, and as I approach the car I just thank god that I have such a beautiful car and drove it to my college at Florida state and got 26 miles per gallon with the air on driving 65 mph, so continue to be very impressed with the Veracruz and I highly recommended to Hyundai that they at least offer the v8 engine, and offer the full 375 hp engine and not de-tune it like its brother the new borrego with only 337 hp, or offer the 290 hp 3.8 engineWe purchased one of the first ones sold love it, minus the paint on exterior is thin chips easy, few interior flaws, weather stripping bad otherwise I truly love it.I have had my Veracruz for about six months now.
* we purchased our seventh hyundai,a vera cruz limited and like our other hyundai's we love the vera cruz.we got the ultimate package,and it is a gorgeous vehicle inside and out,and like the motor trend said it beat the lexus rx 350 and i can see why.gas milage right with two wheel drive at 500 miles is just over 24 mph,so it is the best cross over out there.Have just purchased my first Hyundai and am I immpressed with the Veracruze!!
* this is one fun ride talk about class all are friends can't belive we got this much car and did not have to sell a kid to make it happen.. we where the first in arkansas to buy and boy are we glad the ride is the best handles like no other and the power of the 3.8 is unreal and this thing is so quiet you can't tell its running unless you look at the tac, and i can get in the third row and fit with out getting a neck cramp, room is the key for third row seating and hyundai did it.. this is my third hyundai and the way they are going not my last if they come out with a pick-up truck look out!!!!!
* The interior is roomy.very quiet and easy to drive steering wheel controls nice touch good head clearance for tall person mileage good dealer sold non Hyundai extended warranty without warning.........not good....buyer beware So far (only 1000 miles on my VC) and I'm extremely pleased.
"
62,2007,bmw,z4,4.1,3.4,9,13,"* Fun, fun, fun!I purchased my Z4 for pleasure driving only (sunshine time).
* 265 HP plenty but if you just want manual and 355 HP go for M. It's a fun fun fun car.
* It really looks cheap maybe because I am used to Audi's unusual design but still this is not so good for a BMW.I don't know if there is another car as fun to drive as this.
* It's so much fun to drive, I hate to get out of it.
"
63,2007,toyota,rav4,5.8,3.6,122,90,"* My only disappointment is that the Rav4 is my wife's vehicle, and I hardly ever get to drive it.Get the Sport modelPurchased my RAV4 two weeks ago and love every aspect about it, very very roomy, classy looking on the outside, back seats are like a sedan for leg room, love the new storage area, I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a small SUV, Go out and take a test drive you will be soldawesome power ride and dependability awesome vehicle awesome vehicle so comfortable and easy to drive with awesome power and response just an awesome vehicleThis was my frist new car.
* I have owned a 97 Chev Cavalier (too little and poor quality sold it after 32k miles), then moved to a 99 GrandPrix GTP (loved it and sold it at 130k miles), then I bought a 05 Acura RSX (excellent quality, still that sporty feel that I like but with better gas mileage then the GrandPrix, engine was sorta weak however), Although I was not in need of a new vehicle I decided that I needed a small SUV (something I could grow with).
* But don't take my word for it, take a RAV4 out for a test drive for see for yourself.I bought the RAV4 because I was looking for a SUV that could fit my dogs, carry stuff for the house, have 4WD for the snow and still get great gas mileage and my little coupe just wasn't cutting it anymore.
* It has all the room I could possibly need, handles like my little sporty coupe, has great pick-up for a 4 cylinder, gets mileage similar to a 4 cyl car and lots of awesome little extras like dual-zone climate control, storage space under the trunk, moonroof and alarm system.
"
64,2007,toyota,fj_cruiser,5.7,3.6,156,119,"* Iam dying to take it off road...Soon as Iam off 1,600km....All systems go...I find the automatic transmission exceptionally smooth..Plus there is lot of pep in the acceleration too.. Long & short you just cannot go wrong with this SUV...PERIOD...This is a great eye cather and fun to drive!Love the retro looks.
* It's not a race car and you can't fly around corners, but it's a solid vehicle that doesn't rattle, shake or shimmy like my past 6 GM SUVS have done starting at 30,000 miles.
* Add this up and you have a Top Cat on the block.its fun and great to drive Great fun to drive, looks are great.
* Keep in mind this is an off road vehicle  in fact Toyota advertises the FJ on their website as purely an off road vehicle - there are no pictures of the vehicle used on a road.
"
65,2007,mercedes-benz,sl-class,5.8,3.6,28,20,"* I've had BMW's and S-version Audi's before, and this time I looked at used AM Vantage's (poor warranty) and M6's (sorry - just not very attractive), and considered 911's as well(yes, it's more of a sports car), but as a daily luxo driver in urban traffic that is still capable of lots of hard-top down, rip-snorting fun, this is a very tough car to beat....especially for 1/2 off!The power of 510 ponies cannot be beat when you're behind a truck, along side a slow poke, or just dying to feel the wind in your hair.

* I've owned Lexus, Range Rover, NSX, Corvette, and several Jags and several BMWs--the SL 550 is head and shoulders above them all--it is absolutely the most fun of any car I've ever driven--and that includes the new Aston Vantage V8.

"
66,2007,nissan,versa,5.1,3.6,112,108,"* i was going to get a fit, but then i test drove the versa, and its a much better deal for the price.I was looking for great commuting car and i test drove versa and right away i orderd this car, i got 1800 miles on it right now and i love driving this car because its drive like a midsize car and with SL package you can't go wrong , which has bluetooth and inteligent key get you in and out and even you can start your car without taking your key out from the pocket, 36 miles per gallon with CVT transmission, this is a overall better car than Honda Fit and Toyota Yaris.with a sleek looking exterior and solid built interior, i am proud to cruise around in this car.
* !I have a 2007 Nissan versa, I am having problems with it starting, very intermittent, turn key for about 10 seconds, just cranks over and won't start, wife embarrassed trying to start it also, also am having probems with weatherstripping falling off back doors in the same place, not overly impressed with gas mileage as what the sticker says.We bought a used Versa with 10,000 miles on it.
* If you're looking for a great commuter car that's a great ride and fun to drive, the Versa is a great choice.Being my first ever new car (I'm 34) I did not know what to expect, overall I have been very pleased, with one caveat.
* The Versa's engine performance is good, I don't know but sometimes it is very smooth and give the impression that I'm driving a sporty car, however, othertimes it doesn't give that power.
"
67,2007,dodge,caravan,2.9,3.4,6,15,"* Nice surprise was that SXT came with additional options cruise control, power driver's seat, power slide door and 6 CD player we didn't expect, so we paid $5K less than invoice and avoided taxes altogether, and dealer drove new car over 100 miles to us where we had a mechanic verify it was new.
* Compare to toyota & honada you pay more & get same by the way when you buy dodge help US economy not foreign countyJust the facts: Vehicle bought new  enjoy driving but transmission has been problem from start.
* Radio does not get local stations, transmission had to be re-programmed, (that would fix tranny problems also in these reviews) driver's door re-aligned twice, overhead console loose, failed cup holder, weatherstripping falling out of driver & passenger window and hitting people in head, failed resistor in blower control.
* First new Chrysler product purchased ever and last!I love my new van.
"
68,2007,volvo,v50,6.3,3.8,12,7,"* If you like Volvo's approach to design, handling, and safety the V50 is a great choice over any small SUV.
* The interior design is simple and intuitive, the performance is great, the mileage is decent (considering the way I like to zoom around), the cargo space is great, and it looks awesome.
* OD - New ,Big Brakes 2001 V40 New , K&N , Cool Stat ,Drilled Rotor's Speical Pads, NGK Iridium's 2007 V50 New, K&N, Still Breakin In Motor !
* We will see if it holds up as well as my Honda after 7 years, but doing great so far.I've never thought Volvo was this good.
"
69,2007,chevrolet,malibu,5.8,3.6,22,16,"* It will have to go some to compete with my 1996 Olds (best car).First of all it is great on gas mileage (I have the 2.2 ECO-TEC), I got 500+ miles out of a tank once on a straight interstate trip, usually get 350-375 miles or so with mixed driving.
* Great car, great design, great performance, great reliability.
* Overall the car has been great and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good solid car and doesn't want to break the bank.Before I bought this car I hated driving and this car has completely turned that around.
* Great car though!Bought this car with about 2,000 miles on it, had it for about a year and put around 17,000 miles on it myself.
"
70,2007,chrysler,aspen,6.9,3.3,34,15,"* Even though it looks a little like a Durango....I get asked all the time how I like it and told that it sure is a beautiful vehicle.
* It's good for people that have 4 or more kids We love our Aspen, it handles well and the bells and whistles are awesome.
* This is a great vehicle for the price and has been extremely reliable.This vehicle drives like a dream SUV.
* This is the sleeper SUV no one's talking about.When driving this vehicle you get a sense mof comfort and exictment.
"
71,2007,nissan,350z,6.2,3.6,21,13,"* It is just as exciting, Great looks, plenty of power, looks and drives like it should cost more, excellent value!Motor a lot faster then my 2003, fun to drive, seat quality is a little poor but still a lot of fun on the twisties... great on the track and everyday driving.This is the ideal sports car for its price.
* I believe I got the best of all four cars in my z: speed, luxury, great looks, reliability and affordability!I will be zgo tripin for years to come!This is a very great car to drive.
* So my overall rating is ""don't test drive one if you aren't going to GET ONE!
* Best sports car for the money!I have owned many cars both American made and Japanese, but this car is by far the best quality I have seen in some time.
"
72,2007,dodge,magnum,5.5,3.4,12,10,"* The 2.7L V6 in the SE just isn't powerful enough for a 4000 lb car, especially in steep climbs, and it dosen't have ESP like the SXT and higher models.
* I wouldn't mind having one of the bigger engines, however I enjoy the gas mileage and can't complain about power or acceleration.
* Fun car to drive, I would have bought the 425 horse model if it weren't for price of gas.This Magnum R/T has Performance package.
* Agree with some of the past comments about interior design, could've done better, especially that cruise control stick on the left.
"
73,2007,mitsubishi,endeavor,5.5,3.7,12,10,"* It gets VERY expensive to operate this, along with the poor gas milage (15 city, 20-21 hwy, that's with the expensive Premium gas) I know other people like this SUV, but I can't afford PREMIUM gas all the time.I LOVED my Endeavor... until I got into a 6 car pile up caused by MY endeavor.
* Gas mileage is outstanding and it has so much leg room and head clearance that it is the perfect SUV that a person can and will ever drive.My wife and I have driven ours over 3000 trouble free mostly highway miles.
* Lou Fusz made it so simple and were very nice.1- It needs PREMIUM gas or it runs very poorly (weak, and low MPG) 2- Engine has good power, but only with PREMIUM fuel 3- PREMIUM fuel is very expensive.
* I went by accident by the Mitsubishi lot because I was driving around the auto mall and saw the Endeavor and there was only two left, I drove it and was like WOW this drives just like a car I do go on occasional trips and its great.
"
74,2007,mazda,cx-9,7.2,3.7,70,27,"* Looks like a luxury vehicle, feels like a luxury vehicle without the hurt of the price tag.This is the 1st Mazda I've owned and after having a Honda Odyssey it will be the last Mazda I buy until they upgrade some of the features.
* This is a terrific crossover SUV... very fun to drive, roomy, great- looking, great build quality, lots of features, even has pretty good gas mileage (I got 24.5 mpg on a long highway trip @ 70 mph last week  I get 18 mpg around town.
* Have been in a Volvo V70 with 3d row seat for the last 250,000 miles and was looking for another dependable vehicle, but something a little bigger and one with a higher ride height.
* I find the 2nd row seats very comfortable for my 6'0"" frame, and the 3rd row a little tight for me, but my 5'6"" wife thinks it's just fine.
"
75,2007,mitsubishi,galant,5.9,3.7,13,9,"* I haven't owned the car for a year and it is rustingI've been driving Galants ever since I first started driving and this is the best one yet!
* The 2007 Mitsubishi Galant Ralliart is one of the best mid-size sport sedans.
* I also have a 06' Dodge Stratus that is horrible on gas and bucks on the road when you pass the second gear, so this is a great step up!I just bought the brand new 07 Galant ES with the sport package.
* The performance is great on the road and I love the way people stare!Great vehicle, can't beat it.
"
76,2007,ford,escape_hybrid,6.3,3.7,29,17,"* Ford's better ideaI've had my Escape Hybrid now for 2 months and I couldn't think of a better vehicle to own.
* It doesn't throw you back in the seat when you step on it, but it gets up and goes so smoothly you don't even notice the acceleration.As an owner of 4 SUVS and ready to get rid of one I decided to look into getting the Escape Hybrid SUV for its gas mileage.
* Buy a Garmin instead.I love my Ford Escape hybrid, it looks great, is fun to drive, and gets pretty good gas mileage.
* It's a very quiet running vehicle and sometimes at a stop light it's on battery and I don't think it's even on but it is when I press the gas!
"
77,2007,lexus,is_350,5.9,3.5,22,15,"* The Lexus IS 350 is a great performance car, but if you want a spacious ride this car is not for you.
* Bought it for Lexus reliability, good performance, good handling from rwd, and good review.
* Overall, the Lexus IS 350 is a very fun car to drive.Overall the IS 350 is just about as perfect as a sports sedan can be.
* My other car is a BMW 3 series and there are a lot of thing BMW does better than Lexus.
"
78,2007,chevrolet,corvette,5.6,3.6,48,37,"* The sleek interior design and ultimate performance makes it one of the best I rarely drive my Corvette daily, but I drive it on the weekends around the city.
* I am very please with the car and use it as my daily driver in all seasons except the winter.This is my 5th Corvette and, while everyone buys a Corvette for performance, this one has a great ride and gets excellent mileage.
* Don?t get me wrong the car is so much fun to drive and looks great but the interior quality is very bad and does not compare to any German or Japanese cars?
* Great stereo stock.Have had the Corvette a short time but can truly say it is one of the best cars I have owned.
"
79,2007,kia,sorento,7.0,3.7,35,15,"* It's handles great and the styling inside and out is awesome (take a look at the Lexus SUVs, aside from the emblems they're almost identical to the Sorento).You have to drive this vehicle.
* Buy one and you won't be disappointed.We have owned our Sorento for almost a year now and besides the gas mileage, it has been an outstanding purchase.
* Sorento has the minivan's room, the comfort of Cadillac, the fun to drive sporty handling of the Grand Am, and a bigger foot print and smoother ride than the Jeep.
* The 4WD has been great for the Michigan winters and great gas mileage for an SUV.
"
80,2007,buick,rendezvous,6.9,3.5,27,12,"* My wife drove a Buick LaCrosse, but to her the Rendezvous gives her a comfortable ride and the ease of driving a small car in traffic, but doesn't feel like a full size SUV.
* They should make every GM engineer who designed this do it every day.We were absolutely shocked to learn that this vehicle is the only GM vehicle (including all other Buick models) that includes rear seat seatbelts that do not ""lock"" unless or until it becomes necessary.
* Since Buick stopped advertising the Rendezvous some time ago, you should be able to get one at a great price like I did.I almost leased a Honda mini van.
* Great vehicle GM!We purchased the Rendezvous and absolutely love the vehicle.
"
81,2007,chevrolet,silverado_2500hd,5.3,3.6,10,9,"* You can barely tell you are towing, very comfortable, able to tow our trailer up Mammoth upgrade on 395 with cruise control on, passing all the sad little gas engines on the side of the road!Just put 6000 miles on our 07 2500HD crew cab with the Duramax diesel.
* The only thing I don't like is the gas mileage, I have 2000 miles on my truck so far, and mostly highway driving and I can't get better than 11 mpg.
* Gas mileage seems to be getting a little better with diesel engine (around 19 to 21 on long trips, 16 to 18 in town).
* The interior of the truck makes long drives easy  I wish I had this truck in college, it would have made the road trips even more exciting.I bought my 2007 Silverado because of the new design, and I needed a new truck.
"
82,2007,suzuki,xl7,5.4,3.5,34,29,"* Two days after we bought it we we made a 6 or 7 hour trip to Virginia and the car performed great, we figured gas mileage wouldn't be too good since the car wasn't broken in but it got 23 mpg and was comfortable on the trip, with size and style and features and great price and warranty I have no idea why these aren't more popular, we are very pleased and look forward to many miles with our XL7.
* Love the look of the car and would be 100% satisfied if we hadn't had to keep going back for repairs (the same thing each time) Seems like Suzuki didn't work out all the kinks on the 2007 XL7.
* My advice test drive Pilot, Highlander, Santa Fe and XL7 before you buy one because it's only then you will know if you like it.It took me lots of reading and thought to choose, but when all was said and done I am happy we bought this new XL7.
* I feel very confident when I drive this car in any season.This car is great bigger than toyota and all the others in its class great price and great looking A+ suzuki!
"
83,2007,nissan,murano,5.9,3.6,52,36,"* Interior materials seemed like they were sourced from a Chevy supplier and dash display would be considered acceptable on an 80's era vehicle, not a car costing north of 30k.We started out looking at Chevrolets but the salesman showed us the 2007 Nissan Murano.
* It's a pleasure to drive and more car like than other SUV's.
* Comfort, toys galore, spacious, and a looker.So far, my SE Platinum Murano w/Charcoal leather interior and Chrome Rims is amazing and has far exceeded my expectations and previous opinions of Nissan, as it looks like Nissan got it right with this SUV, and its fine-tuned improvements since it's introduction in '03.
* Drives like a charm... like a big car (not like a heavy truck) which makes it flexible to turn around and drive smoothly.
"
84,2007,chevrolet,hhr,6.2,3.6,74,46,"* It handles way better, almost like a sports car.2007 HHR sure beats the 2004 Freestar.The ride is at least as good, performance is about the same, MPG is about double, and it's twice the fun to drive and most people love the looks.
* I usually get much better then the rated gas mileage, around 38 mpg highway if I watch my speed.I bought my HHR for my wife in 2007 for a nice car to drive back and fourth to work.
* It's a fun car to drive, for a car it's size does well on gas mileage, when I baby it I can get 27 mpg, when I drive more aggressive I can expect about 24.5 mpg.
* It's very easy to get in and get out of too.No it's not a sports car and it certainly isn't a race car , but it is comfortable with reasonable handling and good gas mileage.
"
85,2007,toyota,4runner,5.9,3.6,46,32,"* Love the height of the vehicle, easy to get in and out with children.The 4Runner is a terrific SUV to own and drive, very useful and plenty of power for the needs of the driver who feels like going off-road every once in a while.Very comfortable and fun to drive, great radio system plenty of clearance and the look with the hood scoop and all is awesome.I could not be happier with my new 4Runner, smooth ride and excellent handling.
* I am glad I have my Toyota 4 Runner.After only having my 4Runner for 6 months I can say it is a fun SUV to drive, it handles like a car, looks great, runs great and is quiet except for a slight vibration effect or noise when it's windy, it seems like wind blowing or buffeting against something.
* It will tow 5000 lbs, gets about 22 mpg, huge cargo area with the seats down, seats 5 and with the sunroof open and the windows open is almost as fun to drive as any vehicle I have owned... and I have owned about every make at one time or another.
* The vehicle I replaced was a 1988 S-10 Blazer purchased new  it was a great truck but the new Trail Blazers just did not impress me as being a SUV.
"
86,2007,dodge,caliber,5.0,3.4,154,156,"* It's off now but I'm hoping that in another two days the light is not back on again or I'm not going to be a nice customer!the car started out great good gas mileage was noisy new tires still noisy should of knew something was up when one dealer offered free tires for life there is a part on the transmission that went bad and no dodge dealer knows how to fix they hook it up to machine try to fix but keeps messing up the car goes 20 mph so we cannot drive it and still making payments on it one dealer thinks maybe we should put in new transmission and maybe that will fix it at the tune of 3200 dollars so if you buy this car buy extended warranty would never buy another caliber Purchased new with 3 miles on the odometer.
* I wish this car would blow up when I'm not in it of course.This car drive very well, the engine is very powerful while using as little gas as possible, i do not find this car very bad on gas usage, but very great, and it tends to take a week or so depending on whether or not I am heading out across the state or if I am going across town, it's very reliable, yes it will need more gas to get across the state.We bought this car because of the size and as a winter driver thought it would be safer than the PT Cruiser I had previously.
* Before I purchased this vehicle I drove the matrix and other comparable vehicles also I compared them for saftey and found that caliber was by far the best buy, now that I've owned it for 3 years and have friends that have over 100,000 miles with no problems, I'm convinced that my next vehicle will be another caliber I like the hard quality interior it stands up much better then the soft plastic.
* I traded my Mustang for a more reliable vehicle as I travel often, and I love it, I've had no issues with it since I purchased the vehicle with 28,000 miles, I've so far put 12000 miles, traveled to las vegas and san diego back to new mexico with no issues!
"
87,2007,mercedes-benz,gl-class,6.4,3.6,82,46,"* And far better than Range Rover or the new Audi SUV!I just trade a 2006 E350 wagon I also own a suburban & a 2006 toyota 4 runner in comparing these suv's the GL rides better 'handles better'more comfortable,looks better & more fun to drive What a vehicle.
* It's very stylish without being too flashy, and It truly does seat seven adults fairly comfortablly.I just trade a 2006 E350 wagon I also own a suburban & a 2006 toyota 4 runner in comparing these suv's the GL rides better 'handles better'more comfortable,looks better & more fun to drive What a vehicle.
* We own this and an E-Class, and the GL feels even smoother to drive than the E. We tried all the 3-row SUVs and nothing on the market comes close to the GL.The GL class is by far the most enjoyable and lovable vehicle that anyone requiring cargo space, passenger space, and snowy driving conditions could dream for.

"
88,2007,lexus,rx_400h,3.8,3.5,9,15,"* Around the city the best we were able to achieve was 19.6 mpg when the sticker and dealer claimed it would get 31 mpg or better.
* I get 28.5 mpg on mostly interstate driving during the summer and 25.5 mpg in the winter.
* We even had a factory rep from Lexus drive the car and he could not get it over 20 mpg.
* The Lexus has proved to be a wonderful solution - we have plenty of cargo space inside and on the roof and the hybrid system, while taking some time to get used to, has been just terrific.
"
89,2007,gmc,acadia,5.7,3.6,105,78,"* Although I would like it to have more power it does handle exceptionally well.I always want a car with style of Lexus, drive like a Infiniti, capacity like a Tahoe, price tag like a Chevy and fuel efficient like a Toyota and Acadia is the closest I can get.
* This summer, we towed a 19 foot boat and a storage area full of gear from behind the front seats to the rear tailgate with no loss of power, handling or ride quality.This has been one of the best vehicles I have ever owned, and to my surprise I can't get over how much my wife enjoys driving this big cross-over vehicle.
* It feels so much bigger inside than it looks on the outside, but it still drives like it is small, I love that.Drives well for the first 2000 miles, gas mileage 22 on the road,14 on lots of up and down roads in the NC mountains which is not bad.
* I got the 7 seating with 4 captains chairs so it would be easier for the kids to climb into the back, although you can slide the seats back and down, they usually get to the car before me and I didnt want to have a 3 rows of seats all muckied up by their footprints so this was better for us.Fun to drive vehicle.
"
90,2007,honda,s2000,4.8,3.5,14,15,"* I have had five sports cars over my 40 plus years of driving and this S2K is by far the best overall driving machine I have ever had the pleasure of operating.My wife has owned every boxster style car known to man.
* One drive and you will be hooked.After driving my BMW convertible for 12 years,this car has made me realize what a true sports car convertible should be.Hi Everyone, I just wanted to warn you about my S2000 experience.
* I've owned two sports cars, a 1980 Corvette and the 2007 Honda S2K.
* I will have to say that the Honda S2000 is the most fun car to drive that I have ever owned.
"
91,2007,hyundai,azera,5.0,3.6,61,61,"* I researched as if I were getting a PhD and was surprised to find the research, testing, and then ownership of the Azera has proved to be excellent.this car has been an incredible find,as we researched our new car for literally months,before deciding on a 2007 azera limited,over it's competition,accord v6,camry v6,maxima and even the avalon...it literally blows away the other vehicles...now,the question is,why hasn't hyundai marketed the azera,as they have the sonata and santa fe???
* Six speeds would definitely be better here.Only have had for a month but its as good as advertised great fit, finish,interior is flawless,great power,great dash access,can't find a flaw,have driven Mercedes the past 10 years the Azera is a better car the long term will tell but I don't expect anything but great preformance for the future.3 years ago my wife traded in her Mecedez for a HG350.
* Compared to Avalon XL, Azera limited offered heated leather seats, 17 inch alloys, standard traction and stability control, active head restraints, rear side airbags, fog lamps, heated wipers, homelink and compass, rear sunshade and air quality system to name a few things, all for a transaction price of $1,000 less than my best deal on AvalonI now have my Azera Limited for about 2 weeks.
* This car is sweeeeet.Car is very Nice love the comfort and design and very sporty not very good in snow and paint starting to chip near wheel Wells tires not good in rain or slush or very little snow steering wheel wood grain finish coming off like is chipping In the past I have purchased/driven Honda Accords, Toyota Avalon, VW Passat, Mazda 6 but this Hyundai Azera is the best car I have had yet.
"
92,2007,volvo,s80,6.7,3.8,12,6,"* It is the best Volvo yet and may have already sold me on Volvo the next time as well.
* Plenty satisfied and sharp design also.this is my first volvo, i am impressed at volvo stepping it up this year with a nice s80.
* At 23,500 miles I'm getting 28 MPG on the highway at 75 MPH with and average of 25 MPG city/highway.
* However, safety concerns, gas mileage, and the way features are packaged individually led me back to the Volvo.
"
93,2007,ford,freestyle,6.9,3.7,48,22,"* Only thing that could be improved is my city gas mileage, but I love the power on the highway and when set to cruise, the highway mileage is great for that size engine!Just turned 49,900 miles on my 2007 Freestyle Limited AWD.
* Kids love the seatsand that how they recline and roomy space, the car is comfortable, (lots of leg room too) for short and long trips.I wrote a review a year ago about how great the car was in the winter and on a trip to Florida.In April 09,I still like the car, but the rear brakes needed replacing at 28,000 mi.Dealer said my car was not in the recall period.My response:""I am not paying for new brakes-period.
* Good Luck brother!This is the first long road trip we've taken with our new-(bought used), Ford Freestyle, automatic, 3.0 liter engine.
* ""Ford would not cover them, even though I had the same problem as others.The dealer saw my 8 years of having vehicles serviced and paid for them.The infamous Continental tires were done at 34,000.I replaced with Triple Treads.I am not sure if I will buy another Ford.I really like my Freestyle,but understand why people buy foreign .I purchased this car used with 5,000 miles in the fall of 2007.
"
94,2007,volkswagen,gti,4.7,3.6,52,59,"* I previously owned a MK4 GTi and it was a great car but this one is far better, good job VW.I've had the GTI for three months now and I can honestly say it's a blast to drive, and with four doors, it's very practical as well.
* The GTI however has all the classic makings of the cult phenomenon seen in the previous model, sure it's got a bit of wind noise (way less than previous gen), but if you had too much insulation you wouldnt be able to hear the growl of the exhaust... and if you have ever ridden in a tuned classic beetle you know it's almost deafening but fun as hell.
* The 2007 GTI gets fabulous gas mileage and has actually brought fun back to the daily commute.Ordered my GTI to get all the features I desired (took 4 months from order to delivery).
* It is not bigger than the 2-door, but seems to get more out of the rear row while maintaining near identical trunk space.The VW GTI is more fun to drive than the BMW 325i and it holds four comfortably with room for the dog in the hatch.
"
95,2007,buick,lacrosse,6.5,3.5,20,11,"* Just driving from the dealer after the purchase and driving home, I found the ride to be smooth and very quiet.
* We just love this vehicle of all the previous cars we have owned.Much improved over Century, attractive interior, quiet ride and lots of convenient gadgets, fun to drive has all comforts and feel of larger car.
* If you're looking for a great, roomy ride in this car class, you just have to drive one.We have had this car one month and love it.
* Thanks for a great ride and driving experience.I absolutely love this auto.
"
96,2007,subaru,b9_tribeca,5.6,3.7,23,18,"* She wanted an SUV that wasn't too big, wasn't too small, wasn't the same as everyone else, and had lots of features.
* I wonder what Subaru's service dept is like -- hopefully better than Nissan's!We absolutely luv to drive our Tribeca.
* I've never owned a Subaru, and it wasn't even on the radar when we started shopping, but their $2750 incentive couldn't be beat.
* It's my wife's car and it's the type of car that makes me feel good that she is safe.With the 3rd and 4th seats folded down flat there is room to pack a kid back to college.
"
97,2007,infiniti,g35,5.7,3.6,108,81,"* I have no regrets purchasing this car, but wonder if I should have waited one more year for the redesigned 2008 G35 coupe....Well done Infiniti!Not as refined of an engine/transmission nor as surgical in handling as a BMW 3 Series, but the new G35 sedan is the only Japanese sport sedan that comes pretty darn close.
* Although BMW's steering was more precise and Infiniti has not mastered 0 body roll when making sharp turns, the G35 kills the BMW 3 series and its competitors in every other segment, and again, it's much cheaper.
* ?Was circling the M45 but didn't need all that car (no kids etc) so the BMW 335i was the first car then the G followed - the G is far better value with no sacrifice in performance under 99% of driving - and it brakes and comes off the line far betterHaving owned BMW, Audi, and Acura over the past ten years, Infiniti has a real ringer with the G35.
* Great brakes, great performance, great style, great radio, just an all around great car!!!
"
98,2007,pontiac,vibe,6.5,3.5,30,16,"* The main thing is that I can tow my 16 ft bass boat with this car with no problems and still get out to my favorite fishing spots at (27.5 MPG) far away, with out spending the extra bucks on gas if your looking for a kind of small suv this would make a great choice it gets the job done so far its been very ReliableTraded my Ford Explorer in for the the Vibe and I love it - much better gas mileage and there I find I have just as much room in the Vibe as I did the Explorer.
* It handles well but not great, fits a good but not great amount of stuff, and gets decent but not great gas mileage.
* I average 27 MPG mostly highway miles, but would probably get better mileage if I did not keep the speedo at 80 miles per hour.
* i went from a jeep wrangler to the 2007 vibe best car i have owned so far a lot of funHad 3 Altimas in a row, so I was skeptical about a change, but I love my Vibe.
"
99,2007,volkswagen,jetta,5.2,3.6,60,55,"* Truly German, a poor man's BMW.My girlfriend works for Volkswagen & I was skeptical when she bought her 07 Jetta.I am a die hard Nissan/tuner enthusiast & I am amazed with the performance & smooth ride of German vehicles, in this case VWs Jetta.The car has great acceleration & good power considering its weight & remote 150hp, but could pack a punch when you need it to.The 6spd auto/DSG feature is great & the comfort, interior quality, & ride is amazing, not to mention the car is affordable.Black is the best color for the Jetta as it highlights all of its elegance & compliments the chrome front grille the best.I am in love & will be purchasing one for myself, the GLI of course.This is my first ""new"" car.
* Thanks VW for the hard work in creating and evolving the Jetta for today's environment.This is our first VW since owning a Scirocco in the late 80's.
* It's fun to drive and is nicely appointed, but it's the most expensive Jetta package, costs over $25,000.
* The biggest reason I bought a Jetta again was for their safety record, as I was recently in a head on car crash (I was in a Jeep Liberty).I looked at a lot of cars, and decided that the Jetta Wolfsburg Edition was the one for me.
"
100,2007,kia,sedona,5.0,3.7,22,22,"* Feels really great, driving is a pleasure, powerful engine, attention to the small details, good finish and well constructed car interior and exterior, plus the great price came with, made me buy this baby.
* I love driving this van, feels like your driving a luxury vehicle.
* Would recommend to anyone.My wife and I looked at almost every van on the market and for the money the Kia was by far the best performing, best handling, best riding van out of them all.
* Plenty of interior storage.When I test drove this vehicle I couldn't believe how smooth and quiet the drive was, very surprising for a minivan.
"
101,2007,dodge,ram_pickup_1500,6.5,3.4,45,24,"* Obviously the mileage isn't ""peak"", but it's a V8 truck for heavens sake so that really shouldn't be a complaint for any owner - that said, however, I've averaged about 18.5 mpg so far and even have a cellphone snapshot of it hitting 21.1 mpg at one point (all highway driving obviously - but 21.1 in a V8 pickup truck...awesome!
* tripped from NH to NC and back again and averaged 25.9 mpg with the 4.7 Magnum engine (that's not a typing mistake)Poor performance and 4x4 weak, 19,000 miles and transfer case went south, very poorly designed transfer case, 48,000 sticker price, paid 38,000 new, and less than 6 months later dealers only want to give 19,000 trade in, fuel mileage on hemi is pathetic, 10.9 to 11 mpg, this is the worst car buying experience I have ever had, and that most money I have ever lost on a vehicle through depreciation, come on Chrysler!
* My dad has a Chevy w/ a tonneau cover and gets 20 MPG highway with it on and 17 MPG with it off, my truck without one gets 19 MPG, I'm looking to invest in one to see how good I can get.
* I didn't buy this truck for gas mileage I bought it to play with and tow with, great choice.....at least my dodge doesn't have spark plug issues.....(5.4L)any guesses?I traded my 2005 Dodge SLT 4x4 in on a Cadillac for my Wife, and regretted doing so as I missed it so much, so I bought the 2007 when I had the opportunity.
"
102,2007,jeep,commander,6.2,3.6,34,21,"* But with the 2nd row having a small amount of leg room, there's barely enough room for his car seat, I don't know how he'll fit in it in a another year while still in his car seat.
* Gas mileage sucks, but you already know that if you are looking at this type of vehicle :-)Wonderful SUV with lots of room, off road rides really good, make sure you keep the maint on this car, the only thing is that why would Jeep build a Jeep that you couldn't put a lift on?
* What I don't like is the 3rd row seat (for kids or small adults but ok), it blocks visibility when head rests are up, passenger seat sits to low, very hard to see stop light when stopped, rain collects at driver door, need better cup holders in 2nd row, and air vents make noise when opening to defrost.
* The seats are comfortable and 2nd row leg room is better than advertised (stadium seating makes this row sit higher).Just purchased the Commander Sport, and we love it.
"
103,2007,honda,odyssey,4.0,3.5,86,127,"* good highway mileage 24-25.5, love the XM stereo with subwoofer, handles good even in rainstorm, fun to drive, sunroof is nice even when open, city mileage 13-18 (keep your foot out of it for the 18), great acceleration including highway speeds, van loves to go fast 70-80 no problem, good visibility thru glass and mirrors, comfortable in rear seats, front seat a little hard, steering wheel needs to extend out a little further for tall drivers, kids like the TV and game hookups, overall package we love it.This is one of the most uncomfortable vehicles I have ever been in.
* An overall excellent choice if you like minivans.My Odyssey drives well, The driver seat is good and supports the driver's back (Driving a Toyota Sienna for few hours every day caused me back pain, the Odyssey is much better).
* Handles extremely wellFinally went back to Honda van because of good gas mileage for a van, rear comft seats that went into well  comfortable other seats, leather, moonroof, great driving ability for van class,and great hauling capability for two going-to-be retired couple,plus low platform and again comfort for the aging population.
* We have friends with a $50K Lexus GX470, which is nice, but doesn't feel like it's worth twice as expensive as the EX-L. We added our own DVD system, so the only thing missing is Navigation.I have put 12,000 miles on our 2007 EX- L and so far it's been a very reliable and enjoyable car.
"
104,2007,chevrolet,silverado_1500_classic,5.6,3.6,30,24,"* I did buy my truck and was in doubt, because the all new Chevy Silverado, but I think this one, the classic, looks better than the new one.
* Am still on original tires, brakes.Bought new in Oct 06, like how it drove and performed, very comfortable however now after owning it for 21 months the steering/suspension makes all kinds of noise and feels like it's going to fall apart when going over any uneven surface.
* The prices really can't be beat, and you certainly get your money's worth.I have been driving this truck for 6 months and have only 3500 miles on it, but I am very happy with this purchase.
* Ford F-150 cost more and ride like crap, and don't have the same space as the Chevy extended cab.
"
105,2007,audi,a4,5.5,3.6,52,42,"* It's acceleration from a stop is a little slow, but once you get going, it accelerates quite nicely.I own an Audi A4 2.0T and it is very fun to drive and great looking style.
* Have also had BMWs in the past, the Audi is equal or better in all aspects and would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a wagon for the utility benefit but still wants the style and luxury of a great German car!I love my new Audi.
* Take the kids to practice or give it a spin on the country roads with the wife on a Sunday afternoon: both can be fun in this solid family sedan -- the 2007 A4.This is an unbelievable car that has as much ""pep in its step"" as a BMW, but with more elegance and minus a couple thousand dollars.I have been driving BMW's for the last 16 years, but just purchased a pre-owned 2007 A4  the tight ride, the excellent gas mileage, and the bang-4-the-buck were the overriding factors influencing my decision.
* Still pretty happy with the car though, an overall pleasant drive.Did my research... Audi A4 wins in most categories: fun to drive yet economical  great design aspects, but not too cutting-edge  very comfortable ride, and of course, excellent German engineering throughout.
"
106,2007,acura,rdx,5.3,3.6,87,78,"* The Lexus and BMW equivalents to the RDX can't even compare and the RDX is even more fun to drive than the TL!
* In the last Month my RDX has been in the shop three times and the last time it didn't even last a week before the emission light went on again and when it goes on it seem to shift down and have less power it has been in the shop this time for a week and they don't know what's wrong with it they are in contact with Japan now and still have no idea what's wrong.
* I love driving this so much that I kinda want to be on road all the time.I've owned the RDX for a month now and I still can't wait to drive it - I look for excuses.
* Deffinately recommend buying...This Car says it all RDX is the most incredible suv on steroids the ride is superb and the agility witht ht sh-awd doesn t make you move when you make a sharp turn just eay and pleasant...Awesome tag to high but still KICKS RDXIt is really to early to tell alot, however my first tank of gas seem to yield me only 13.5MPG ... and I did not dog the SUV.
"
107,2007,subaru,impreza,6.2,3.7,40,24,"* The best purchase I have ever made and I only paid $22,300 with just 81 miles on it.In my honest opinion I think this car tops all cars right now on the market, it's sleek, it's fast, it's great looking too.
* It handles great, the AWD grips the road very well, decent amount of power, and fun to drive.
* The performance is THE best for the price, I love the interior and the seats, the steering is crisp, the transmission is smooth, the brakes are awesome, I'm getting better mileage than I thought with a turbo, 25-26 mpg, especially considering the way I have been driving it, and I can't get the grin off my face everytime I think about getting back in it.
* The power in the sti is ferocious, coming on at 4000 rpm's (which is when the turbo kicks in) and then it's hold on for the ride.
"
108,2007,chrysler,300,4.5,3.3,28,34,"* Very impressive.It is a really nice car I have enjoyed driving it but I need better gas mileage because I drive 82 miles a day to work and cannot afford the gas prices.I've been admiring the 300C since its debut in 2005, and finally went out and bought one  a 2007 300C SRT Design model.
* Good Job ChryslerI love my new 300c from it's classy looks to it's wonderful ride.
* Fuel economy is great and the car is a joy to drive.I've only driven my 300C for 3 weeks, but it's lived up to the great reviews I had read prior to choosing it.
* Thumbs up to Chrysler for making this sharp hot car!I love my RED CHRYSLER 300!
"
109,2007,cadillac,srx,5.0,3.4,17,17,"* This Cadillac has everything I wanted in a new vehicle: great looks  smooth, powerful acceleration  comfortable ride  and attractive, well appointed interior with many driver convenience features.
* Having driven it near it's limits at a C&D ride and drive last year left the feeling that it could be our new vehicle when our Envoy went back.
* I think the car could probably benefit from a slightly larger wheel size but as that would only decrease MPG I am happy enough with what it came with.We've owned Cadillacs over 30 years but this is first crossover vehicle.
* It has all the performance that one could ask for.This vehicle is absolutely the best vehicle I have ever ridden in.
"
110,2007,mercedes-benz,c-class,5.3,3.6,60,54,"* It is so much fun to drive, and gets to designated speed very quickly... electronics work very well, and the entire car in general is very comfortableOK this my 2nd C-class, had to get away from the simple luxury of the 240 move to an exciting fun to drive cold blk on blk 230.

* A great addition for those wanting pinpoint turns, control, and great handling in any conditions.Even for the least inexpensive model Mercedes, this car packs a lot of power and appeal.

"
111,2007,lexus,gs_350,5.1,3.5,37,35,"* Love the manual shifting option.This is my 3rd Lexus vehicle and looked at Acura RL, Mercedes CLS, Mercedes E, Lexus LS 460, and Lexus ES 350 before purchasing my GS 350.
* As for reliabilty  this is my second Lexus, and if it's as sturdy and dependable as my last one, I won't be disappointed.I am so happy I waited for the GS 350 - I almost bought the GS 300 last month.
* The quality is not much better but it sure does cost a lot more money.I have had 3 Lexus GS's now and I do say that I love Lexus.
* I have an unreliable, not quite an ES 350, four door sedan.The only bad things I have seen that people say about the Lexus GS 350 has to do with the inabililty to use the GPS and Bluetooth systems while driving.
"
112,2007,acura,tsx,6.1,3.6,34,22,"* I guess I was expecting a slightly better MPG given the TSX comes with a 2.4 liter 4 cylinder engine, however the TSX is engineered to maximize full use of this engine.Will consume just about the same amount of gas for a 4cyl as a 6cyl TL, the TSX lacks power.
* It's a great car!I wanted a sporty vehicle that was much quieter than my 2005 Celica but just as fun to drive  the TSX delivers that, along with the leather package, 6-speed ultrasmooth gearbox, sunroof, bluetooth, premium sound package, and good mileage to boot.
* The car is great fun to drive, accelerates smoothly, but you'll pay for the fun at the gas pump.I just went from a 2004 Honda Accord EX-L to a Acura TSX with navigation system and I must say that I am happy with my decision so far.
* The car is absolutely fun to drive, I cannot wait for a new, refreshed version of the TSX, hopefully with more room and better gas mileage, also with more power.
"
113,2007,chevrolet,equinox,5.2,3.6,40,37,"* Like this vehicle more now than when I bought it.I rented this car first and then when t went to auction with 16,000 miles on it I bought it and it's the best driving and handling vehicle ever.
* We got rid of my wife's ""fun car"" '05 Mustang and got the Equinox and we both actually like to drive the Equinox better.
* I didn't like the parking brake location (hard to reach when engaged), and the fact that the rear seat does not fold down even with the back floor (made it hard to put large objects inside) Overall, not a vehicle I could live with long term.Bought it for my wife, and we love it!
* Bought brand new in '07' still haven't reached the gas mileage that it's supposed to be getting and i do a lot of highway driving, when bought it got 16MPGs, now only at 18.3MPGs.
"
114,2007,kia,rondo,6.5,3.7,58,31,"* Turns shorter, rides better, speedometer easier to read, seats almost as good, fuel consumption 15% better at 8.4 l/100km, roomier, better visibility, more sun/sky glare that's a no no, tailgate stays cleaner of dust and mud, 2 inches more road clearance is important on snow and back roads, I miss PT's sturdy rear shelf, Electrically heated seats work well in Alberta, drives good but does not hold the road as good as ""the little TANK"".
* But other than that has all the bells and whistles that higher priced cars have and feels safe and secure on the road, went from a Subaru Legacy wagon, huge improvement for our family, very easy with kids car seats,lots of room in front for drivers (5'10""230 lb football player) and man can it move when you need it to,long drives are now fun but city driving will kill your wallet,but worth it, don't miss out on this for a better name brand car is worth the test drive.Awesome power off the line for a 4 banger.
* Great ride, great comfort, great features, great price, we opted for the 100k/10 year warranty (bumper to bumper) for an extra 1k which translates to no worries for a very long time.
* Overall impression: If you're just starting a family or just want a nice vehicle to drive around in it would be hard to find a better deal than the Kia Rondo!Just got our Rondo EX, I am 6'3"" and Rondo has excellent headroom and good legroom.
"
115,2007,gmc,canyon,7.3,3.6,8,3,"* Lot of cab room but the cheap interior kinds of kills thatI bought my SLE Crewcab, 5 cyl., auto, 4x4 last August, worked it hard this past record snowfall winter.
* It has great towing capability and I get a lot of standard features on a base model like remote keyless entry, cruise control, and intermittent wipers.
* Given the size of the competitors small trucks GM could have given the crew cab a longer bed than the 5 feet.
* Always owned Toyota's bought this because it was cheap, and had a lot of power out of the 4 cylinder.
"
116,2007,subaru,legacy,5.1,3.7,25,24,"* Strongly recommended.We have the 2007 Legacy with SI-Drive (Subaru Intelligent Drive), which gives the engine 3 modes: Intelligent (great for around town and best fuel economy) Sport, standard mode, and Sport Sharp, which gives it better performance for sport driving.
* Before you buy a new or used Legacy GT with the 2.5L turbo engine, be sure to take a thorough test drive and make sure you don't have the same issue many owners of the 2005 - 2008 MY Legacy GT experience.
* I had an Acura previously and while I think the Subaru is much more fun to drive I miss the interior quality of the Acura.Traded in a Mazda 6s 5speed for the Legacy SpecB.
* My Accord had all of those things, but what it didn't have was the uniqueness and fun to drive characteristics that my new Legacy has.
"
117,2007,hyundai,tiburon,4.7,3.6,20,23,"* Then, on top of the great performance, it turns heads wherever it goes, and I look and feel great in it.Bought the Limited model V6 runs great even though the 4 seemed OK .. moves well in traffic ... compares well with the Eclipse, 350Z and other similar cars...I get lots of looks...many think it is some other kind of car costing 6 to 15,000 dollars more ... LOL ... this car is fun to drive and worth the money.I loved driving this from the moment I pulled it out of the dealership!
* I have owned 7 vehicles and paid a lot more for the others but love this one the most!When enough people find out about the Tiburon and drive one, I'm sure Hyundai could raise the price of this car by $5,000 - possibly more.
* Overall, one great sporty coupe!Great car, reliable and fun to drive.Bought it for my wife and daughter, now they can't get me out of it!
* It is so fun to drive and as far as reliabilty, mine is too new to know, however with the great warrenty Hyundai provides, if I do have any problems, they will fix it for a very long time.
"
118,2007,hyundai,sonata,4.8,3.6,126,138,"* But with Camry and the Accord being out my price range, I test drove sonata and was shocking surpise it had as much horsepower and more safely features and a much much better warranty.I was able to get the sonata limited for less than I was going to pay for the base camry with icthing cloth seat.its a really great car to drive thanks Hoover Hyundai, i'll see you in 3 years when i get my Azera I've only had my Sonata for a few weeks but so far I love it.
* Gas mileage not as good as I thought it would be especially on the highway (for its size and make of engine - V6).I've been in the automotive industry for over 25 years and the Hyundai has come a loooong way since its inception when i test drove this car i was totally impressed and bought my baby and i'm glad i did I'm a big guy and find it a little cramped on long drives which i do daily the winshield post kind of creates a blind spot the drivers seat could be repositioned needs more leg room the outside mirrors should also be collasable it has great back seat space and plenty of trunk space it drives incredibly well very smooth love the power of v-6 it seems to have some shifting issues not smooth all times the sound system is great love the heated seats the climate control system lacks someI like this car all except for the fuel milage, The window sticker is rated 20 city 30 highway, Im lucky if I get 22 miles per gallon on average, and I'm not a hard driver.
* enough to make me go check it out but when i got to the hyundai dealer i saw the sonata gls xm with a 4 speed auto triptonic with heated mirrors, am fm xm cd mp3, power winders, power mirrors, cruise, tlit,maplights, 6 airbags, and sunglass storage and remote keyless entry, plus the alarm, tire warning pressure all just for 18,445 dollars and by the timne i brought it it came to 19,245 dollars..for the accord i would had got a alot less things and no auto.. anyways i am more then happy with my buy and would advise anyone to buy itI bought the Hyundai Sonata because I am fed up with North American car that keeps on braking after 100 000 km.
* They are very similar cars, but I like the ride and handling of the Hyundai Sonata better than the Camry, and it's easier to get into and out of as well.I was ready to purchase a new Ford Fusion and on a whim I drove a new Sonata.

* I've put almost 19,000 miles on it in 17 months and it's been a very good car.This car is actually very nice to drive in the summer (or places that do not get more than a few inches of snow a year).
* They are suprised when I say it's a Saturn.I like the fact this car does not sell well because I would hate for some one to discover Saturn's best kept secret!
* I have always drive a GMC Z-71 but living in Atlanta GA and driving 25,000 miles a year had to retire my truck to the driveway and get a car that fits my driving budget.
"
121,2007,cadillac,sts,5.0,3.4,11,11,"* For the price, looks, convenience, build quality, gas mileage, we are extremely pleased with this machine.I've enjoyed owning my Cadillac STS - I can sum up my experience like this: reliable, luxury, solid, head-turning, quiet, smooth, f-a-s-t!, beautiful, graceful, turns on a dime, great stability and best of all, my 6'6"" husband fits comfortably....I just leased a 2007 Cadillac STS V6 all wheel drive.
* For the same price, you could get a BMW that is MUCH better!This is the first Caddy I've ever owned,and I am truly impressed with everything about it, I love the way it handles, and the comfort of the ride.
* Like most people on this forum are stating, this car looks great, rides great, preforms great, stops great, etc...
* I have owned 5 BMW cars and a friend said to drive the STS.
"
122,2007,volvo,c70,5.5,3.8,16,13,"* Owned with this in mind, it is a nice vehicle--no cowl shake, peppy, comfortable seats, great exhaust note, gets lot of positive comments from bystanders, fuctional interior & controls.It's my wife's car, but I get to play with it on weekends.
* No regrets!I thought I was getting a sporty, luxurious convertible  after 2500 miles, it's just a reliable Swedish 4- seater hardtop convertible  Sporty- car is too heavy & the suspension is like my old man's ?92 Buick Park Avenue  acceleration- good  cornering not tight  steering- too loose  also, it looks sporty for a Volvo, but come on, consider your baseline  Luxury- nice overall amenities, but there?s room for improvement (see comments below  also, no sunglass case, for $48K?!)
* Try it, you will love it!Love to drive my C70, unfortunately, the majority of it seems to be the 50 miles one way to the dealer for the Check Engine light repair.
* So if you want something that does pretty much exactly the same thing, but isn't ""me too"", go for the C70.Got one of those 6000 imported C70 2007 babies, and I'm really enjoying it.
"
123,2007,cadillac,dts,2.5,3.4,5,15,"* I will consider another DTS in '09.This car combines the best of the European driving characteristics with the best of American luxury features to give the driver, and the passenger, a fine balance of automotive performance.
* It is comfortable, enjoyable to drive, good looking, and I know of no other vehicle that meets the same standard.I have driven many Cadillacs in this series over the years like the Concour, Performance DTS, etc.
* It's solid American iron and I don't think it needs to apologize for anything!The car looks nice enough but interior design needs help, may as well put the radio and A/C panels & controls on the floor since it is necessary to turn & look down to see them.
* I've bought new before, but this time I went for one that was exactly what I wanted if I had bought new, plus certified gives me another 80,000 miles and 6 years bumper to bumper.
"
124,2007,mazda,mazdaspeed_mazda3,6.0,3.7,31,21,"* Creature comforts + Performance + Style= Way more than $25k Great car for money.This is primarily my wife's car and was purchased for its 5-door functionality and fun to drive quotient.
* The bottom line is that this car is hot, has a very comfortable interior, has amazing power, great handling, great breaking and did I mention... it's FAST!!
* A lot of fun, and you won't get it into any trouble that it can't easily get you out of.I have put many happy miles on my still young speed 3.
* Reasonably priced, great performance, great style for a 5-door.The best car under $50k.I'm in my mid 40's.
"
125,2007,nissan,xterra,6.0,3.6,30,20,"* Gas mileage could be better, but if you bought this vehicle worrying about gas mileage then you brought the wrong vehicle.
* About the car: if I drive like grandma I get 17 mpg highway, if I drive normal, I get about 14 mpg.
* This SUV has everything we wanted out of a 3rd vehicle, comfortable seating for 5 people with good leg room, on the fly 4WD, and plenty of good power from the engine.
* For less than $30,000, you get excellent acceleration, amazing handling, lots of space, good visibility, 8 airbags, ABS, the best stereo in class (Car&Driver, and my opinion), excellent off-road ability, 4 skid plates, 4WD, 5 speed auto, smooth and quiet highway ride, and many other not- so-visible features.
"
126,2007,ford,escape,6.9,3.7,29,13,"* The handling is exceptional in all weather and conditions.We love driving around and so far the weather here has been mild, so we can't wait till we get some bad weather to see how it performs under those conditions.This is my first new car and so far I love it, it's so smooth and so easy to drive it's unreal  after all it is an SUV.
* I'm averaging 24.6 (through the first 4,100 miles) MPG with the V6 which has been the most pleasant surprise.Bought vehicle with zero miles, drove through 2007 New Year's Day weekend blizzard in New Mexico after putting on only about 500 miles - 2WD (front wheel drive) awesome in snow - went through over 50 miles of 6 - 12"" deep snow with few or no problems.
* In addition to being much easier to park, this little Escape handles well, rides well, looks great, and seems to be pretty well made.Just got my new 2007 Escape XLT, and its only been a few hundred miles, and I love every minute of driving it.
* As a single person it's what I need - the look and feel of an SUV without the enormous price of one.The Escape is a relatively inexpensive, fun-to-drive small SUV that also happens to get pretty decent gas mileage.
"
127,2007,bmw,x5,3.9,3.4,17,27,"* Much slower, less comfortable (the sport edition seats are incredibly uncomfortable)things like my cell phone can't charge when the car is off,and that unbelievibly annoying seat belt alarm (you can't put groceries on the passenger front seat as an example) makes really angry at BMW.
* This SAV is as close to perfect as any of my previous vehicles.I was so excited to get one of the first 4.8i's in production (November 2006) to the point that I never considered that the car would be anything but better than my old 2003 4.4.
* More features like run flat tires, xenon headlamps, etc., are standard equipment but on the others they are options  nicer looking and zero cost maintenance warranty, the kind of warranty you used to be able to get with a Mercedes.This is my 4th BMW X5 and the first one I am not in love with.
* Kind of disappointed since for the last 10 years every car I have owned has been a BMW.This new BMW X5 is a shocker.
"
128,2007,toyota,corolla,6.2,3.6,65,39,"* My other car is Huyndai Elantra and believe me the difference in ride quality is huge.This is a great car - if you want a reliable car that gets great gas mileage this is it - I do not understand why Toyota produced a later model Corolla that does not get as good as gas mileage as the earlier models.I bought the 07 CE model early this year.
* I got the 6 cd changer with 6 speakers and that thing is loud and clear, I love it!I have owned my toyota for about a month I traded in a 4x4 ford F150 with a huge V8 for this little nimble toyota corolla I was getting about 17 miles to the gallon in the truck I drive from Ohio to Alabama every other weekend and the Truck was killing me in gas.
* But with that said, if you are looking for a basic dependable car that gets great gas mileage, the Corolla is hard to beat for the price.Good car for gas mileage.
* OK gas mileage, though I admit my mileage is 90% city (averaging around 27-30 mpg, 34-37 when I do drive highway).I bought this car 10 months ago and it still feels like a new car.
"
129,2007,dodge,ram_pickup_3500,3.6,3.4,5,9,"* Very quiet and ride is good considering it's a one ton, great power (6.7 Cummins), smooth trans., 3.73 and 6-speed seems to be a great combination.
* Great truck except for the fuel mileage and the hesitation in engine between gear shifts its a 6 speed manual.
* All that power of the 6.7L and I couldn't use!80,000 miles in 6 months overall truck does the job but the 6.7 engine has been nothing but problem after problem.
* Power great, good mileage in breaking 18/23 mpg.
"
130,2007,infiniti,m45,5.3,3.6,16,14,"* No problems whatsoever, great sound system (I got the sport model with the nav/tech package).After test driving almost every model made by BMW, Mercedes, Audi & Lexus, I was surprised that the Infiniti M45 was the most comfortable, fun to drive and intelligently designed of the bunch.
* Car handles very well, better than my BMW 530i.I test drove BMW 335i and xi, 328xi, and 535i and xi, and although these cars were more aggressive driver's cars than the M45 sport sedan, I purchased the Infiniti.
* Both were wonderful cars but I like my Infinity best of the three.After test driving almost every model made by BMW, Mercedes, Audi & Lexus, I was surprised that the Infiniti M45 was the most comfortable, fun to drive and intelligently designed of the bunch.
* I have been looking for a while and narrowed my choices down to BMW 530i sport and Infiniti M45, I was leaning more towards Infiniti although it was more expensive than BMW but I was able to get a great deal and all the options I was looking for.
"
131,2007,honda,pilot,4.9,3.5,66,70,"* Lots of cup holders, cargo space, and lots of space in the front to put those items you always seem to have lying around in the car, sunglasses, tissues, maps, etc.I test drove a Honda Pilot, then a couple other SUVs, my 7 yr. old son got out of the Nissan that I drove and said ""Gee Mom, that was not as comfortable as the Honda"", he was right!
* The posted ratings on my window sticker were: City - 14.1 L/100 km (20 mi/imp-gal or 16.7 mi/us-gal) Highway - 9.7 L/100 km (29.1 mi/imp- gal or 24.2 mi/us-gal) The actual average fuel consumption for a variety of driving conditions is Actual - 16.6 Litres/100km (17 miles/imp-gal or 14.2 miles/us-gal) The best highway fuel consumption I've had from a weekend driving trip just matched the city rating shown above.This is my best car I have bought.
* I have owned 10 Honda's and this one has not disappointed.I have never even been in a vehicle with better storage area that services the driver, as many cup holders for the rear, and overall family friendly design.
* I have owned my Pilot for 6 months now, and I really enjoy it!Very little power and not enough joy in driving the vehicle, way too much money for the fit and finish of it when you really look at it up close.After a lot of research and many test drives, the Honda Pilot was the one that grabbed my heart.
"
132,2007,mazda,mazda5,6.3,3.7,41,24,"* However in the summer this vehicle is fun, it gets great fuel economy, it's practical, great to drive and easy to park.I love my Mazda 5.
* Any car that is this safe as well as fun to drive, nice looking and roomy - what more could you ask for?I absolutely love my Mazda 5 but there are so many small things about it that drive me crazy seems though its brand new.
* LOVE IT!Pretty good, but its huge list of features have to include the following in the next 2 years: a 5 or 6 speed automatic, rear air conditioning, standard tinted windows, an available V6 [maybe from the Mazda6], a panoramic sunroof =D, power sliding doors, Bose speakers, a better screen for the navigation system, a smoother transition between gears, 2nd row outboard armrests, dual zone auto-climate control, power front seats, a ""shark fin"" antenna instead of the weird one it has now, a bigger center console, and more power outlets.
* Trade in was a Mazda 6S and we think the 5 is more fun albeit much less get up and go (power).After 6 weeks of ownership, my impressions confirmed what Consumer Reports said about the Mazda 5 w/Auto.
"
133,2007,honda,civic,5.3,3.5,229,203,"* And everyone says that it gets better gas mileage as you put on more miles, so believe it, this car can easily get 50 mpg if you drive like you are supposed to and don't try keeping up with the gas guzzlers going 75 mph on the freeway.
* IF you buy this car you better be lucky, some get 35 MPG some get 19 MPG and if your one of the lucky ones to only get 19 Honda doesn't think there is any problem.
* The average is around 31 mpg instead of the 38 mpg ( talking high way ) I just traded my Honda 2004 CRV for the Civic Ex 2007, very happy, the car is fun to drive, mileage is so much better than CRV.
* My initial motivation was the gas milage (as it was with the CRV), but I've been truly impressed with the performance (While it isn't as fast as my old turbo beetle, it gets superior gas mileage, and isn't as fear inspiring as the Volvo was when entering the freeway), as well as the ergonomics.I am very happy with my new honda civic.
"
134,2007,nissan,sentra,5.4,3.6,78,67,"* We highly recommend the Sentra and the dealership that we purchased the car from.I've had the car for 2 weeks and I love it, traded in my ""98 Nissan 200SX SE-R very happy with the new car it looks like it cost a lot more than it did, it's eye catching I love the way I see people breaking their neck looking at it and it's just all around comfortable to driveThe Only Thing that is the same with last years Sentra is the Name.
* When the dealers are ready to deal at the invoice prices, I think it will be a good buy.just traded my murano in for the 2007 sentra which looks like a mini maxima.. have the sl with cvt which was a big selling factor.. beat civic in my book also compares well to the jetta.. great sound system .. nice power for a car this sizeI bought this car couple of months ago, so far it is giving me very good mileage like 29 city and 35 highway.
* So even if you don't like the civic as much, it's worth it because of the gas mileageI bought my 2007 Sentra 2.0s new.
* In the first month of driving the car is getting 33.6 miles per gallon, not bad, and I expect it to get a little better as the car is broken in.it was time to trade and i was tired of paying all the money out for gas, so my wife already owns a 06 nissan quest,and loves driving it more than my lexus, so i went to check out the new sentra and was blown away by it compared to the 06 model.
"
135,2007,volkswagen,eos,6.5,3.6,69,37,"* I love the sunroof - it's not something I use because it's way too loud when open, but it's great to have the sunlight in the winter - convertibles can be dark when the top is closed - not this car!I purchased my Eos, the 3.2 with sport package after driving the 2.0T.
* Do your homework and test drive everything else before driving an Eos, because once you test drive you to will be hooked on the Eos!I love the Eos.
* I live in a place where we get a lot of wind storms and that was my concern with the hard top convertible, but it's absolutely no problem - unlike what's said about other hard top convertibles that have no idea what a huge wind sail they put up.
* It's jack of all trades character in regard to coupe, convertible or open sunroof auto, it's performance and it's comfort reassure me each and every day that I made a good decision in investing into the VW Eos.
"
136,2007,bmw,5_series,5.1,3.4,46,45,"* All the new electronics (voice activation, navigation, iDrive, iPod, bluetooth) are worth every penny especially if you use your car as your mobile office.I love the drive, acceleration, the grip feeling that gives when you are getting into curves.My 550I is fun to drive, especially on the open road.
* Solid handling, fun to drive, great stereo and I love the Sirius radio.
* Still getting used to the comfort seats (standard on 2007 SP) but I think I will like them better than sport seats on 2004.Well balanced and fun to drive.
* I like my BMW so much that we replaced my wife's Audi with a BMW 530xiT too!
"
137,2007,scion,tc,5.7,3.9,77,59,"* A/C vents aren't placed well, it's hard to get air to blow right on you.The Scion tC is not only a good looking car but it is very fuel efficient and also low in cost so it's perfect for everyone.I have not had any problems so far with my tC.
* There's nothing actually WRONG with this car, it's just that after a few months driving it, I've realized that I've just bought a pretty standard economy car, the number one issue being that it's no fun to drive at all.
* It combines Toyota's reliability with a Lexus-like style, I have already lowered my tC it will just get better and better as I modify it over time!The Scion tC is a very well equipped car for the cost.
* It doesn't have a bunch of bells and whistles, and it would be nice if it gave me more mpg, but I love driving this fun car and it didn't break the bank.It was between the Civic and the tC, and in performance on the road, let me tell you this guy rocks for a 4 cyl.
"
138,2007,chrysler,town_and_country,3.8,3.3,15,24,"* Replaced a power window motor, the power steering motor and something else with in the steering wheel, had 2 bad tires (drove with a flat-sensor didn't come on), replaced brakes at 18K, it's in now for bad roof leaking in 3 spots and a sunroof rattle.
* Vehicle is comfortable to drive and ride in, the carrying capacity is unbelievable, and as much as I hate to admit, it is very good family vehicle (I never thought we would own a minivan).
* It is so comfortable, and for a van, the gas mileage is very good (at least 20 mpg).Leased this vehicle in Feb. 07 and just mailed Chrysler the check to purchase it.
* The overhead controls for fuel mileage, etc, were confusingAs much as I tried to like this minivan, I just can't and here's why.
"
139,2007,lexus,is_250,5.2,3.5,44,40,"* Heated/cooled seats are great  handles like on rails  plenty of punch, but wish the 350 came with AWD  has been great on snow and ice  ride a tad rough but an OK compromise for the handling  very quiet  love the LED interior lights  back seat is cramped, but front seat is fine for my 6'4"" frame  averaging around 25 mpg  many more features and much more reasonable price than BMW or MB.I love the design, all the great luxurious features, like the headlights that turn and the cooled seats.
* Take a test drive and you will see, really a fun car and great gas mileage too.This car has it all - luxurious interior and fun to drive!Astonishing outside design, I personally think it was most beautiful car in the same class, no doubt with the car quality, and yes, this it my ever perfect & accurate choice for choosing this car, I'm totally satisfied!I am a long term BMW owner (325i, 325is and M3) but have grown tired of the electrical problems that seem to plague recent 3 series models.
* Yes, the shifter is easy, the Lexus doesn't make you work for a shift like the Infiniti G35 coupe 6MT did nor is it as precise as the RX-8, but it is more forgiving, allowing you to focus on the road and enjoying the great interior rather than focusing on making the quick shift.
* Great touches and features like interior lighting, auto dimming of the nav at night tied to the dash lights and light sensor (and not just a manual nav setting), easy bluetooth, buttery leather, etc.Looked at the BMW and Audi and made the only decision after driving all.
"
140,2007,buick,rainier,5.0,3.5,7,7,"* Sounds like the back window is open a little on both sidesA real truck with real towing capacity, yet as quiet and smooth as most luxury cars in town and on trips.
* I purchased the Rainier because the seats in my 2004 LeSabre were so uncomfortable my wife could not ride in it for any distance, even though we had zero problems with it over 85,000 miles and still experienced 32 mpg on the highway and 22 in my commute to work.
* The Rainier's ride is great, wind noise in minimal, seating comfort is perfect (I'm 6'4"" and my wife is 5'6""), and the towing and carrying flexibility are outstanding.
* Not an old man's vehicle anymore!OK, like most of us in my age group (40- 50) the name Buick is not a vehicle we are familiar with unless it?s a Buick Grand National, an 80?s muscle car!
"
141,2007,toyota,prius,5.4,3.6,91,78,"* Great gas mileage about 48 mpg.I get between 38 and 42 mpg doing both city and freeway driving, but I have a lead foot, so I could probably get better gas mileage if I drove slower.
* It seems to get better mpg on just highway driving - about 55 mpg, In just city driving it is more like 45 mpg.
* I do a lot of driving for work and needless to say, the gas mileage is great (although I usually average around 45-46 mpg) but the extra features like bluetooth, backup camera, mp3 jack, navigation, and in-dash cd changer are what I really love the most about it.
* We traded in a Ford Escape Hybrid and the Prius gets much better gas mileage and is much quieter and fun to drive.
"
142,2007,nissan,maxima,4.7,3.6,54,60,"* Drove a few luxury sedans G35 TL and pricing and options on the Maxima SE matched others and own 2 other Nissans 1986 300ZX turbo (my fun summer car) and 2005 Xterra.This is my first Maxima I have always been a fan of the Maxima.
* For me, it was the best combination of sportiness, size, reliability and looks.I had an '04 maxima SE, traded for a 2005 honda accord Hybrid (big mistake) now back into a new 2007 maxima SE loaded w/ leather, NAV etc.
* I traded my 03 Maxima SE in on the new 07 Maxima SE thinking that it was going to be a major improvement over my 03.
* First let me say the Maxima doesn't come close to the overall ride quality of an A8, however for 1/3rd of the price the Maxima drives very well, is tight, quiet, and has every feature and more of an A8.
"
143,2007,toyota,highlander,7.4,3.6,20,7,"* This is such a basic oversight I can't believe I spent over $31K for this vehicle.Looked long and hard at what was available out there, and Highlander Limited is the perfect vehicle if you want a well-built, reliable mid-size SUV that doesn't go off-road.
* The gas mileage is better than I expected.My husband and I bought a highlander (V6 without the third row) 3 days ago and we love it.
* We saw the Highlander -- hadn't really considered it because we drew the line on price and fuel efficiency previously in going with the RAV, but the price came down to the point we could afford it, and the gas mileage is acceptable, and the comfort is excellent.
* We got a V6 with 4 wheel drive and a 3rd seat for the price of a RAV4 with a V6.
"
144,2007,infiniti,fx35,6.4,3.6,18,10,"* If you want straight out luxury with no feel of the road the RX is for you.If you want to feel like you are driving get the FX.
* Plenty of room, tremendous bose satellite radio, extremely comfortable driver's seat.It's a wonderful driver's car, giving me SUV convenience with sports car performance.
* The aggressive styling sets it apart from any other vehicle on the road and the 20"" wheels add a sport stance that looks better than the standard 18"" wheels.
* Very sports sedan like(was thinking of getting into an AcuraTL or Infiniti G but being 6'3"" and accustomed to the higher entry of the SUV went with the FX, happy!
"
145,2007,nissan,titan,5.6,3.6,37,29,"* If you're in the market for a great looking truck, with plenty of comfort, room, and power... look no further than the Titan LE.After looking at both Toyota and Nissan, I felt the Nissan had better features, especially the bed channel system---of which has proven to come in handy for securing cargo with the short bed.
* Good power, roomy, good on gas (kinda) and it will out run the new tundra great truck.I've kept an eye on the Titan since they came out in '04.
* It converted an old Chevy dog like me back to a Nissan Titan fan.I have always driven a Chevy Silverado except I owned a new Ford F150 for 3 yrs 99-2002.
* I previously owned a Tundra and the Titan is a much better vehicle in almost all phases, plus reliability with my Titan has already surpassed the reliability in my Tundra.
"
146,2007,acura,mdx,6.5,3.6,111,59,"* I know it's not eco-conscious, but it is the most fun you can have for the money and still feel like a star pulling up to Spago.Having owned two Toyota 4Runners, a Lexus RX 300 and a 330, and having test driven the 2007 Lexus GX 470 and the BMW X5, I can say without a doubt that the 2007 Acura MDX - my very first Acura - is the best SUV I've ever driven and much more fun than driving a car.The SH-AWD system alone is worth the price of ownership.
* Comfortable and sporty ride, easy and very responsive handling (SH-AWD and ADS), very safe feeling vehicle, very good engine power, great Acura ELS Surround sound system (DVD-audio, Dolby prologic II, 10 speakers), very good speech recognition for Navigation, audio systems and Hands Freelink, front and second row seats are the most comfortable we have ridden in.
* 1) The bottom of the steering wheel feels like a food grater as the sharp and hard stitching sits above the leather, 2) the navigation system is at least 2-3 years behind in features with only 2D maps and ugly text for street names, 3) the AUX input requires an iPod at full volume, 4) the voice recognition is worthless and unusable, it's wrong at least 75% of the time, 5) when you drive in an ""unverified"" area (my home of 50 years) there are annoying warnings that don't go away without a lot of attention, and the worst, 6) the steering is so hard my wrists hurt when trying to turn a corner.Exceeds every SUV I compared to.
* I really enjoy driving this vehicle (which I think drives like a car).My husband and I fell in love with the MDX in 02  bought it and when we needed a second vehicle, got another one in 03.
"
147,2007,audi,s8,6.4,3.6,9,5,"* What I didn't expect when making the decision, and to my great surprise (since it is almost impossible to test drive them prior to purchase) was: 1) how great it handles, drives and performs, 2) how modern the electronics are (iPod and satellite and telephone integration  systems and suspension control), 3) how comfortable it is AND how much fun it is to drive, and 4) that it keeps getting better.
* And I don't miss my 997 a bit.I traded in a BMW 645 Cabriolet for the S8 and at the time was worried that I might miss the BMW.
* The S8 is always the car I reach for first... that says a lot.I bought my S8 because I believed it would be a fun-to-drive, relatively light weight fast sedan.
* Handling, acceleration and the paddles - pure fun - truly wow!My decision was between a Mercedes S550 4 matic sport and the Audi S8.
"
148,2007,dodge,grand_caravan,5.0,3.4,15,15,"* We were going to get a crossover but this had better mileage and a lot more space and better features - and better, more nimble cornering than most.It may be a bit early to tell, but I just bought the 2007 Grand Caravan SXT and so far I really like it.
* The ride quality is superb, the stow and go seating is class leading (love the extra storage room when middle seats are up), and the driver's captain's chair has proven comfortably ideal for both high mileage and in and around town trips.
* Too bad this couldn't have been better was nice to be able to take all the kids in one car.We bought our 2007 Grand Caravan SXT used without 23,000 miles on it.
* is good and I like the ""Stow-n- Go"" seating.We purchased the Grand Caravan SXT used (Program Vehicle) in late December 2007.
"
149,2007,mercedes-benz,slk-class,5.5,3.6,24,20,"* To change from SLK 280 to SLK 350, which had one, dealer wanted $10,000, instead of the $4,000 difference of MLP of $4,000, for models, since my SLK 280 was a used car.
* To change from SLK 280 to SLK 350, which had one, dealer wanted $10,000, instead of the $4,000 difference of MLP of $4,000, for models, since my SLK 280 was a used car.
* Just for the fun of it I may consider moving up to the 350 or AMG when I come off this lease.This is my second SLK and I like this model much better.

150,2007,toyota,sienna,4.9,3.6,25,26,"* The Toyota just ""feels"" like a quality vehicle.The third minivan we've owned: a 1990 Dodge Caravan, a 2001 Honda Odyssey, now a 2007 Sienna.
* We have always owned Hondas, and actually prefer the styling of the Odyssey, but found the Toyota to be more spacious with better power, an an equally smooth ride.I bought it this March 2007, XLE model with 17'' tires, tri zone automatic climate control, traction control and so on.
* If you own a minivan now and it's not a Toyota, it will be well worth your time to drive this around.The resale, fit and finish, stability, reliability, transmission, engine, dash board views, and rubber/ plastic movement and sound surpass the other minivans.
* Power window on driver side is hard to regulate.We narrowed our search for a good big family car down to the Toyota Sienna XLE or the Honda Odyssey equivalent level.

151,2007,audi,a6,4.0,3.6,8,12,"* My speedometer is 3 mph fast and the front cupholders aren't great - otherwise nothing compares for this 6'2"" 220 pounderMy car is actually the Audi A6 2.0 TSI and it has what it takes to make it big among its German stablemates.
* I am having so much fun figuring out how to use the console to its fullest potential.The Audi A6 3.2 Quattro S-Line virtually embodies my vision of what a luxury performance sedan should be.
* Audi's indifference to these acknowledged problems is beyond belief.I researched all german and japanese sedans in the $40,000 to $60,000 range and Audi was one of the last I drove.
* The navigation and MMII systems are lackluster.This is my 2nd certified used Audi A6, the 1st was an Avant that I kept until 185,000 miles and it still drove like new.
"
152,2007,mazda,cx-7,5.4,3.7,133,112,"* It was the first one delivered in the area and no doubt has some new model quirks, but that does not explain a vehicle delivered with major misalignment that scrubbed the first tires in 10k miles, nor the turbo lag, nor the awful gas mileage (17-19 in almost all country driving), nor the terrible handling in snow (except straight ahead), nor the brakes that went metal to metal in 20k miles.
* But, it is a car with speed and if you are looking for a vehicle with good room, sexy design, and performance and last but not least, a MAZDA, then you will be in complete heaven!The cx-7 is the worst front wheel drive vehicle I have ever owned.The standard equipment Turanza tires had to be replaced at first snowfall!
* Toyotas are great reliable products, and there are many people who love the isolated ride, but for those who like to experience the ""Sport"" in SUV, the CX-7 is a great alternative.
* This car is great, fun and easy to drive and I love it.We first saw the CX-7 at the Chicago auto show this past winter and my wife and I decided it was the vehicle for us.
"
153,2007,hyundai,accent,5.5,3.6,44,36,"* Overall I'm glad I made the purchase for the money it's hard to beat and my girlfriend actually says it's nicer than her Honda Civic.I bought mine in July 2007, and loved the ice blue color, I don't like the placement of the front left windshield pillar, it blocks the view sometimes, first tank of gas was 42 MPG, I drive 20 miles one way to work, currently i get 32-34 MPg but not by driving 75, I go 65 on the freeway, the cars has lots of zip, I had to get the basic model, and really miss the keyless entry and power door locks, so far it's been very dependable, I did notice a slight hesitation after backing up then press on the gas it waits just a sec, then goes, a new car shouldn't do this.prefer the seat back to be more adjustable ie lean further backMy husband and I purchased our Hyudai Accent GLS 4 door sedan right after the Labor Day Holiday.
* It accelerates to highway speeds effortlessly even with the automatic transmission however while accelerating hard the little 4 cylinder does sound a bit ?busy?however All in all it is a great little car!i just bought this 07 gs car a week ago, the only one they had, black with black interior its an automatic....i can say becouse i have the 98 accent too (gsi), that this new 07 is 5 times the car of the 98, i would recommend this to small car buyers in a flash, and the warranty!
* I didn't get great gas mileage on my first tank, but I'm on my second tank and am expecting 30 mpg in entirely city driving.
* The intertor design gives the driver easy acess to all of the switches and knobs.At first, the car didn't really turn my head, but after driving it for a month, WOW, it's automatic and it gives me more than 30 miles per gallon, it's a drive so friendly and soft, you think you're in a car of a better class.
"
154,2007,jeep,liberty,5.8,3.6,31,22,"* What a joke.We too noticed right off the bat that the gas mileage was horrible: about 16 mpg average: we took our jeep to a great mechanic who laughed and said you need to understand that Chrysler uses crap parts: he started by lubing with amsoil synthetic, threw away crap spark plugs and installed Bosch Platinum +4's, nitrogen in the tires and now we average 25 mpg which is a great improvement.
* Gas mileage isn't great but no surprise with an SUV.If you want a small SUV that has great off-road capability and still provides a decent city and highway ride, this is it.
* Again, quality control really needs to be addressed.I just bought a used 2007 Jeep liberty sport and I love it so far the gas last for a long time and its so fun to drive!
* Overall a great vehicle with excellent build quality and great trail rated capability.Looking for a small/mid-size SUV that really is a Sport Utility Vehicle?
"
155,2007,lexus,rx_350,6.0,3.5,47,31,"* A bit pricey, but if you are looking for a reliable, luxurious, sporty but classy medium sized SUV, this new RX 350 is worth considering.Just purchased the new 2007 RX 350 AWD with Premium Package Plus with options (18"" wheels, towing, HID auto level, moonroof, gen 5 navigation, auto rear hatch function, bluetooth wireless).
* My next vehicle will be a Lexus also.I have owned 3 different SUVs: 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee LE / 2005 Mercedes M-Class / 2007 Lexus RX 350 (AWD).
* Excellent ride, very plush, comfort for all passengers-I really enjoy this car.Just purchased the new 2007 RX 350 AWD with Premium Package Plus with options (18"" wheels, towing, HID auto level, moonroof, gen 5 navigation, auto rear hatch function, bluetooth wireless).
* If there's a downside, it's that it's so quiet driving along at freeway speed, it's easy to let your mind wander.
"
156,2007,nissan,altima_hybrid,6.4,3.6,34,19,"* i feel like i won the lottery...i am constantly looking at every altima that i see to see if it is a hybrid...and when i see that it is not...i just smile...it is nice being one of very few that actually know about this fabulous car...i love it...it is beautiful, sexy, quiet, powerful, roomy, sophisticated, etc...i am a proud owner...i gave her a name...bought her a duster...covered her seats...the drive is superb...i have had several cars in my life...but it is different once you purchase the 2007 nissan altima...it is truly unexplainable...i am glad that i went car shopping when i did...i have no regrets...Beautiful car that is fun to drive.
* So, after reviewing both the Camry Hybrid and the Altima Hybrid, I thought that for the price, the Altima Hybrid the better deal and several days ago I bought one.
* The hybrid has all the familiar comforts of my old Altima but with the benefits of a hybrid... and the extras that come with the Convenience Package.After owning an 07 Camry se for about a year, I decided to trade it in for the hybrid altima.
* Overall, if you are looking for a sedan that combines a great look, roomy interior, and gas economy, you will not find a better deal than the new Altima Hybrid.After recently purchasing my altima hybrid i knew i had made a great investment.
"
157,2007,kia,amanti,4.5,3.7,9,11,"* if i was ever in this type of car market, i'd buy a used one in a heartbeat (they have terrible residual value and it's a spectacular car) -- you could get it for a steal.I purchased my Amanti because I wanted a comfortable car with all the options without a high price tag.
* Anyone that drives a 2007, 2008, or 2009 Amanti with the 264 hoursepower engine will LOVE it.It's been a year now since my purchase and I'm still a fan of the Amanti.
* At least - don't buy anything - until you've looked at the Amanti.JUST traded in my 2002 Lincoln Continental for my new loaded Amanti.
* If you are looking for a Lexus or Cadillac at firesale prices, this is the one!I bought my Amanti primarily for my wife in January 2008.
"
158,2007,gmc,sierra_1500_classic,6.7,3.6,8,4,"* Very comfortable!This is a great truck with a comfortable interior and an impressively smooth ride and quiet engine.
* It has a lot of utility, ride is smooth and it's quiet for a truck - and more comfortable than any car I've driven or ridden in.
* Ergonomics are excellent Highly recommended So far I'm satisfied with the ride, handling, comfort, and dependability.
* It's a great ride, with a powerful and reasonably efficent V8.
"
159,2007,mercedes-benz,clk-class,4.7,3.6,28,32,"* Drive one and you will likely buy it--if it's too pricey, opt for a 550, but get the sport suspension--it makes a huge difference.Having parted with my '05 Audi A4 3.0 Cab, I knew I would have to do with out the topless experience.

"
160,2007,chevrolet,malibu_maxx,6.4,3.6,9,5,"* The interior, well, on the LT it's cloth, not leather, but it's just as swank as my work mate's Accord LX - it's workaday, no doubt, but for a mid-line interior it's got what the others do.
* Styling is great  mpg decent for V6 power  comfort  utilitarian design  safety features.I have had my Maxx for 6 months and put 15,000 miles on it due to my commute and the Maxxhas impressed me every one of those miles.
* I don't understand how some people here are getting 29 mpg however, because I am getting about 18 mpg in mostly city driving.
* Felt like I had this car for years, even though my previous car was a large rear wheel drive, the Malibu took no time getting used to it.
"
161,2007,jeep,wrangler,5.4,3.6,83,72,"* Don't get me wrong it does not ride like a car but with the improvement in comfort from the TJ to JK I fell in love with it and drove my Jeep off the show room floor that day!The on-road drive is Wrangler's best... the off-road driver is even better.
* Its truly a lot of fun to drive and gives you so many more options, went from an avalanche and haven't missed itIt's loud, blows all over the road, has bad gas mileage, it's uncomfortable (forget long drives), and let me ask: WHY would an engineering flaw that causes the ever- so-common ""death wobble"" be tolerated by consumers?!
* Love the 3 piece hard top also have soft top, great ride for a Jeep really any suv.
* I would highly suggest this vehicle to anyone who is looking for a fun vehicle with improved practicality!So far I must say I'm happy with my new '07 Wrangler 4 door, but a little concerned.
"
162,2007,chrysler,crossfire,5.0,3.3,7,7,"* That I can smoke those little Mitsubishi's and VW's at redlights, 2. that I can consistantly get 26-27MPG when driving 80-90 on the highway, 3. that I can put the top down without getting out of the car, 4. that I can take corners at 80 that my Jeep can only take at 50-60, 5. that my wife can't pack 400lbs of clothes when we go on a trip & she is OK with that.
* I bought the base model to get the 6 speed manual because I was told it wasn't available on the srt model so I bought this and priced adding a stock supercharger and its around $11,000 they definitely could have pushed more horsepower out of that six just look at Hondas S2000 4 cylinders no turbo or supercharger and pushes more power, less weight, cheaper price, and a quicker 0-60, and last it also handles better.
* This is my daily driver, but stock tires (Conti's) are not good on any snow, wet driving is good  you'll need better tires if driving in winter conditions rims are staggered but you can go with staggered tires if you can find the right ones.
* As for now, no regrets!I've always wanted a roadster but didn't want used and couldn't justify the price of new until now.
"
163,2007,lexus,gx_470,6.2,3.5,15,9,"* I drive my daughter everywhere in the Lexus & as a mom here are my 'annoyances': uncomfortable arm rest, not enough/poor center compartment design, unreachable CD-changer in glove compartment, shallow/poor location of front cup holder, inaccessible cup holders for rear seats when baby car seat is used in the center, rear seat A/C but not heat, swing open tailgate vs. lift-up, can only power on sound (not video) from front console for entertainment system - must use remote control to power on.
* The GX drives very smooth, brakes are great as well as all the safety features.This is the greatest vehicle I've ever purchased.
* The SUV hugs the road, drives great and Lexus's comfort is unmatchable to any other car.I have always purchased BMWs, but decided to get a Lexus for a change.
* This is something I am going to keep for a while, a new one is worth the money.This is my first Lexus and I love it, superb driving and luxurious.Never liked SUV until I got into a GX 470.
"
164,2007,nissan,altima,6.0,3.6,132,88,"* Going to the dealer next week to get suspension and steering looked at but be careful and pay attention to the test drive before buying and if you already bought like me then pay attention and get it looked at if neededWell here it is the end of March and i have 5500 miles on my car.What a great experience it has been.This 2007 Altima handles the road even better than i had expected a true pleasure to drive and own.This is my 3rd Nissan I really love them all.
* I couldn't be more satisfiedFun to drive quick pick up push start is great lots of new options one touch auto roof is new great idea sportier looking car standard side & curtain airbags a big plusI've had the car only 3 weeks, but I began enjoying it the moment I drove it off the dealer's lot and back to my hometown 30 miles away!I purchased my 3.5 Altima SE in mid November 2006.
* !Bought car used with 23,000 miles on it, traded in 2006 spec v completly bolted with nismo add on, altima is beauty of a car I got the 3.5 se and the power is great, have had less than a week and I have been to dealer twice passenger front seatbelt was broken and it had been in a slight fender bender which sales man didn't tell me about when reading the carfax to me I should of read it myself, bonehead move on my part, all in all it is a Nice car but the oem bridgestones are like driving on the original caveman wheel, LOL, extremely loud on highway to say the least.
* I get ~24mpg average and ~27-28 highway.I really like this car, i just got it and put 300 miles in a day.........i like the way it drives, i test drove a Camry, Accord and they were both nice, but softer and more luxurious ride.....this things feels like a 2 door, and a real sporty one at that....CVT is a dream, and it sounds like a bimmer (exhaust).......all in all i'm happy with it, we'll see how it fares down the road...incredible performance that easily outshines the competition.
"
165,2007,lexus,es_350,6.0,3.5,96,63,"* It is very fun to drive, great NAV system, bluetooth phone system very clear compare to Lexus 2006 version, very quiet while drive in highwayHaving had 2 Lexus automobiles previously (both ES 300s, one a 2000 and the other a 2003) THIS 2007 KNOCKED MY SOCKS OFF.
* Great exterior styling and interior design.Fun to drive, easy to start, everything works  the standard audio system is fine unless you are an ""audiophile""  good gas mileage (about 22-23 MPG) in all around driving  run mid-grade gas rather than premium and have not had any performance issues.Car sounds like diesel when it is cold.Transmission slips between 2nd & 3rd gears when cold on uphill.For more than a month I researched and test drove 5 different competition sedans before deciding on the ES 350.
* More fun to drive than 2006 ES 330.I traded a three month old Mercedes E320 CDI for this this Lexus ES 350 Ultra and couldn't be happier.
* In summary, it doesn't have the soul of my 528, but it's a great compromise when looking for a classy ride with great power at a great price.I just finished a trip to and from Canada of about 1600 miles.
"
166,2007,gmc,yukon,6.1,3.6,46,30,"* I'm hoping the gas mileage improves, but I didn't buy a full size SUV thinking it would get 30 MPG.This is my first GM product, and so far so good.
* I tried several others before buying this, like Lincoln Navigator and the Escalade, but for the money this is the one to own.My wife and I love everything about this vehicle (except my wife complains that she never gets to drive it).
* My wife wouldn't let me get the Denali(cost), but I have enough features on the one I got, so I'm not complaining.
* I look at it as the cost of transportation, how else are you going to get 4-7 people around in one vehicle?I searched for one year to find a used one that had eveything that I wanted.
"
167,2007,pontiac,g5,5.7,3.5,37,28,"* I would have no problem buying this car again.My 1st car and just clicked over 13000k and so far the car has been good through the summer and very reliable in winnipeg's -40 weather.Brakes rust really badly and look terrible behind the revealing rims.This car is tough to upgrade power wise without putting alot of money into it,it can handle bolt ons but anything more and you will need new injectors and a tune that will void your warrenty.Premium fuel is recommended and it shouldn't run without it if u want optimum performance, but with the price of gas its getting harder to afford the extra 10-15 cents per liter.Gas mileage is so so i get about 24mpg all city.Overall very good car in 5 speed very fun and i recommend it!
* This was my first new car, and I couldn't be happier.Don't get me wrong, I love my G5.
* The G5 is a good look decent all around car, but just don't offer the kind of performance it should at the selling price.I love this car, i got it as my first car and i love the features i got.
* Overall, a great car and my favorite yet of the 4 cars I have owned.I love my new G5 it is fun to drive.
"
168,2007,subaru,forester,6.1,3.7,31,20,"* Good price point for all you get on a Subaru.This is the second Forester we have bought and it's just a great, practical car.This is my third Subaru, our first one and still housed is a 2000 2.5 RS 2- DR, then a 2004 Outback Sport, now our 2007 Forester.Generally pleased with purchase.
* I've been driving small SUVs for about 10 years, and this is the best car yet--best handling, most comfortable,and best looking.My 07 Forester is the best of all worlds for a small SUV.
* From the outside this car looks like a soccer-mom transport.The ride in this 2007 Forester is terrific, and apparently Subaru has made some minor changes that customers wanted: there's a holder for the iPod, for instance, and road noise is minimal.
* I also don't use my brakes as much because the engine slows the car down when you let up on the gas.This is my first Subaru and the AWD is excellent.
"
169,2007,mini,cooper,4.4,3.4,28,36,"* The Mini is fun to drive and gets good gas mileage but it has two serious faults that would keep me from buying another Mini.
* I got get it checkedI love this car, have no regrets, its so much fun to drive and when you have to drive an hour to work each way you need a fun car.
* I don't think it's too much to ask that the speedometer be accurate.The normally aspirated Mini Cooper is a great deal of fun.
* This is the cutest and coolest car I've ever seen, and I hope to drive another one some day, because it is just so fun to drive, and I love the way it feels as you drive along the streets.
"
170,2007,chevrolet,suburban,4.0,3.6,28,42,"* It's all about what you want, but don't be fooled, it's still a Chevy.Only bad thing I can say is, ""Why aren't there latch seats on the drivers side on the 2nd row bench?"".
* It drives great, has tons of room (way more than the Lexus), looks great (I love the ?07 redesign), and gets far better gas mileage than the Lexus while providing more power.
* I know others with much smaller SUV's that don't get as good milage and we have much more room!
* This is a great vehicle, I have gone from a Mercedes and Ford Powerstroke to one vehicle, and it fits the bill.I absolutely love my new Suburban.
"
171,2007,volkswagen,passat,5.1,3.6,78,75,"* I owned Volkswagen 2006 jetta it was shaking so I traded it for 2007 passat it driving me crazy I had new tires and balance done but car shakes stearing wheel its not shaking but whole car does, I think for new car it wasnt supposed to shake, it feel like hitting car jumping as soon as it gets to 40 mph, ,can anyone tell me if it has same problem with volkwagen, overall car starts fast like hell, and when I put cd in I wait for ever to start, it doesnt start in 20 min or more, ,and dash board sounds so annoying, like, it fallin apart, let me know if this is normal for Volkswagen since both jetta and passat shake while driving, jetta had good cd player,07 Passat sedan recently purchased (20K), looks great, handles well, but is the creekiest car I have ever owned.
* If you are looking for a new family car check out the new Passat, you will not be disappointed.The 2007 Volkswagen Passat 2.0T has excellent all around functionality, a great feel, great design and it gets good gas mileage too.I have 20,000 miles on my 07 Passat 2.0T.
* This wagon is getting better gas mileage that our 2006 Sedan....same engine, same transmission....maybe we're just driving it better, or maybe it's just a great wagon.I purchased this passat new it was our second the first one a 2000 went 80k before we got rid of it, we had absolutely no real mentionable problems with that, that got us around 40 miles to the gallon.
* I hope the car remains reliable over the years, as some studies show that VW's can have reliability issues.We owned a 2006 Passat Sedan - great car, never had a single issue  fun to drive, good gas mileage, loaded with good features - an Audi at 60% the price.
"
172,2007,pontiac,torrent,4.3,3.5,20,26,"* ]...parking brake / cupholder design is poor to say the least ... there are better vehicles out there for similar price.....my 2004 pontiac montana was a much better vehicle...My Torrent is definately not a winter vehicle.
* Mileage is a little less than expected but my husband insists it's because the engine is newits a great midsize, longer wider than most more room with fold flat seats, see real good, service is great, great dashLove our 2007 Torrent!
* I will be looking for another Torrent to replace this one.Own a 2007 fwd torrent - seemed like a good vehicle for first 20000kms, then - a lot of little/annoying things started to happen: - tire pressure sensor malfunction [still is, despite two trips to dealer]... signal lights work, but 'clicker' has stopped working..driver door lock malfunction [cant autolock all doors]...traction control system is MORE OF A HAZARD THAN ANYTHING - I turn it OFF whenever I'm driving in snow and ice [which is very often!
* Also, you'd think for a smaller SUV, it would get better gas mileage.

173,2007,ford,expedition,6.9,3.7,29,13,"* I have driven full size SUV's for 12 years and I must say this one is the most fun and best one I have owned to date.
* I must say this new Expedition is the best vehicle I have ever driven...outside my son's Honda S-2000!We ALWAYS wanted a full-size SUV and of course it was the mileage problem that stopped us from doing so.
* The seats are comfortable (7 hour stretches), the vehicle is quiet at interstate speeds, and the radio far surpasses the 2007 Yukon.
* The vehicle came with second row captain's seats, which makes access to the third row very convenient.

* Let's see, It has nice overall styling, great power, luxury seating / interior & comforts that match just about any luxury vehicle, plus tremendious utility.
* Well to be the first on the block I guess you have to pay to play...lol.The new Cadillac Escalade EXT is the phattest Cadillac ever!
* Plaudits to Cadillac on this one.After 20 + years of Silverados I decided to upgrade to an EXT since I've retired and don't really need a ""working truck"" any more.
"
175,2007,gmc,envoy,5.3,3.6,16,14,"* I would not buy another but I would rather buy an American car rather than some Honda or Toyota.After driving a '98 Tahoe for 9 years, with its poor brakes, poor gas mileage, and sloppy handling, it has been a real pleasure to experience the performance of my 2007 Envoy Denali.
* Rides like a luxury car The Envoy Denali is far better than the Toyota Highlander and Honda Pilot that I drove for years.
* I test drove a Toyota, Honda, and Nissan and were really dissapointed their quality of exterior styling, ride and handling, and est EPA.
* We test drove the Toyota Highlander & offroad Toyota as well as the Nissan SUV.

176,2007,audi,a8,5.0,3.6,9,9,"* The rear seat room is amazing and my girls love the power rear seats!The most beautiful car I've ever owned.
* I've had an A6 2.7 which was fun  still have an A6 4.2, (2002) which is still solid and fun to drive.
* Fuel economy is what you expect in this class, and when considering the performance (and the way I drive), it is rather good.I looked at all the luxury models in this class, this car can't be touched for the money you pay.
* Stunningly luxurious interior, classy exterior, polished demeanor, great acceleration from 350hp V8, dazzling 19"" wheels that turn heads, super attention to detail, nimble handling that belies its size, and so much more.
"
177,2007,cadillac,cts,5.8,3.4,22,16,"* I got the CTS sport w/ 18"" wheels...I would recommend this car to anyone in the market for a new car.The Cadillac CTS has very good quality.
* We should have bought this car a long time ago.I love my CTS Sport, it has the 18"" Wheel performance and appearance package, handles very well for the size.
* This is the best car I have ever owned.The 2007 Cadillac CTS is a sporty, tight, well designed vehicle.This automobile has all the expected features of a smooth and quiet luxury ride and also has the quickness and power of a sports car.
* (6 years/100,000 miles)Fun to drive, rides great, drives great, handles great, tight in rear seat behind tall driver, tough to get in and out of (deep door cills).

* Daughter's boyfriend just purchased an 08 PT based on what he saw with ours.Bought a 2007 touring, mars blue color with 23k miles on it (was a rental car), rides great, inside pretty comfy, love the blue dash, fun as heck to drive, 2.4L has good pickup, wish glove compartment locked and had the chilling feature like the Caliber, my gas w/local driving is 14.6-14.9 with no change in 1 month so that is terrible.
* PT's are small type SUV's and wagons, the little convertible may be classified as a car but the others are not.I can't say enough good things about the PT Cruiser.
* I'm totally pleased with my PT Cruiser!I've owned my 2007 pacific coast highway edition pt cruiser for almost a year.

179,2007,bmw,x3,5.1,3.4,39,37,"* I work home-office so do not use the car a lot - only 7,500 miles per year average, however, it is quite enjoyable to drive it every time I go the airport and go to pick up the kids at school.Fun to drive, great handling (for a SUV) with the 19"" and sport package, a little rough riding at times though.
* I buy a new car every two years, last one was a 2004 Acura TL--not the most expensive car I've owned, but far and away the best car in every category.
* This is my first small SUV, I am a car guy but I travel where there is snow a few times every year and I wanted to be able to take something on my trips that would drive like a car but be able to take the weather with no worries.
* So far no complaints.Bought this car for my wife who was reluctant to own since she doesn't like the tight, sports car like ride.
"
180,2007,chevrolet,cobalt,6.0,3.6,79,53,"* If you want something that's good on gas, fun to drive and cheap, the Cobalt is a good choice but I wouldn't buy a GM product unless I planned on keeping it for 10 years.
* Love the exterior looks, love the dash and interior layout, plenty of space for me and comfortable seats, excellent gas mileage (currently getting about 29.7 city), fun to drive, smooth ride, great features (automatic headlights, auxiliary audio jack, MP3 player), affordable, all in all a great car to own and drive.I was looking into something sporty and reliable.
* I have only been getting around 20 miles per gallon in town which is a big disappointment to me because I was told this vehicle would get around 25 miles per gallon for in town driving.I bought my Cobalt brand new in 2005, so I'm sure by now Chevy has tuned the model up some.
* I take this car 600 miles in a weekend just about every month and it's a blast to drive.Great car, with good gas mileage, performace, quiet, good ride quality and handlingOne of the last 07's on the lot.
"
181,2007,jeep,grand_cherokee,4.4,3.6,40,51,"* When placing my Jeep gear it will jerk real hard, then when pushing on the gas the Jeep will hesitate and lose all power, I too drive to work in heavy traffic I am scared to death that I will be in a fatal accident, last year I took this Jeep to the dealership and explained what the Jeep was doing he explained to me it was bad gas, it now does this a lot, I once again took it into the dealership he explained to me this time that it was the transmission module which of course is not covered in Chrysler wonderful life-time powertrain warranty how Nice this is going to cost me a pretty Penny, so I have been reading on all these complaints about the same problem come on Chrysler recallThis was my 2nd JGCL.
* This is the 4th Grand Cherokee I've owned, and the first I've had problems with.We purchased our Jeep in Sept. 2007 and have had it back for repairs three times in the last two months for the same problem.
* Recently I experienced a problem where the Jeep would not shift out of 2nd gear, the dealer updated the computer & I haven't had a problem since, also, the power window motors when bad & were replaced around 22,000 miles, I am currently at 33,500 miles.
* The vehicle only has 11,000 miles on it and the Chrysler Dealership repair shop first said it was a fuel problem, then it was error messages identifying the transmission, and now the dealership has told us that it is unable to duplicate the problem and has given us the Jeep back with no repairs being made.
"
182,2007,volkswagen,touareg,6.6,3.6,19,10,"* I have owned BMW's and Audi's and I like the Audi feel of the Touareg in terms of ride quality and German feel.
* The Volkswagen drives so much better, feels better (its the euro feeling), same mileage, much more power, but everyday I enjoy the vehicle more and more, its not the Volkswagen our parents had years ago.This mid-size SUV is a great SUV.
* My wife and I enjoyed the car for the first 45,000 miles but since then the Touareg can't make it 500 miles without a check engine light, bad cooling fans, sunroof and windows that mysteriously open by them self,power seats that fail, X brake that won't release, etc.
* I have owned a lot of BMW's and one Audi and you just can't beat the German car feel here.
"
183,2007,nissan,pathfinder,6.2,3.6,18,11,"* It's meant for people who have great style and class I have not had any problems what so ever and the ride is smooth and comfortable with a third row seat the running boards make it look great and its got great take off for a v6.We bought this car for what it is, an honest reliable car.
* I took delivery of my pathfinder le a week and a half ago, i""m really enjoying the 266 hp engine, the appointments of the cabin really are well thought out the bose system, converts my suv into a concert hall.......I truly endorse this suv beauty......I think if you purchase one you will be as happy as i amI was going to buy a 4Runner Limited , but after driving it, we were unimpressed.
* The car is roomy, drives nice (on smooth roads), handles as expected for an SUV, and great for hauling kids to school, it just feels safe and we bought this instead of the 4 door Jeep Wrangler for this reason.I love this vehicle, has everything I wanted including factory navigation.
* I always had American vehicles since I was 16 well I am 30 now and thought it might be a good idea to get a truck and boy I am sure glad I did our last winter was the worst winter we've had in a long time I love playing in the snow and climbing tall mounds of snow just to see how far I can push it, it never got me stuck its the best and most comforatble/relieble truck ever and it's stylish and very preppy.
"
184,2007,honda,accord,5.3,3.5,146,132,"* Watch Out RoadThis is my third Honda vehicle and the best by far owned 89 Accord Lxi sdn had a 2006 Accord EX-L 4cyl now the best 2007 EX V6 love the car it had great performance love the way it hold the road and the mileage for a V6 is the same as the 4 cylinder I had last year this is a great vehicle and I am a proud Honda owner.
* Hope this its helpful.Purchased my new accord and i have to say i love it drives great handles great and has an interior that's awesome second accord for me so it makes me very happy to continue with accord as it's one great vehicleVery nice, capable and competent sedan.
* The car handles great and is fun to drive, great job Honda, a satisfied customer.Fun to drive, very good mileage, interior is ok, reliable, handling is good and I like the performance.We were very excited about our first Honda.
* My third Honda keep up the good work.I've been driving a hybrid,, first the Honda Civic and this is so much more luxurious, comfortable, all the bells and whistles... very good mileage, and with winter here.. the heated leather seats and sunroof and great sound system always make it a pleasure to drive.
"
185,2007,mazda,mazdaspeed_mazda6,5.4,3.7,19,16,"* It'll beat your friends cars in performance, looks better, probably costs a little more, but it's all about priorities.In 18000 miles now, I've been to the dealership 5 times, 4 for service, and once for a check engine light (put crappy gas in it), handles very well, a lot of fun in the rain/snow with traction controll off.
* Also very luxurious, tons of features, and great fuel economy for it's performance level (0-60 time close to a Mustang GT and avgs between 23 and 26 mpg most of the time, try getting that in a stang) I am 23, am an extreme enthusiast and let me say I could not be more proud of my Mazda.
* I have owned dozens and dozens of cars over the last 40 years and I presently have a Ford Lightning and a Suzuki Hayabusa as well so I wanted a four door that wouldn't lean in turns so badly that it would scare me in an emergency, or had mediocre brakes when I am used to having truly great binders verging on racing brakes (especially on my bike) that can get me out of trouble if necessary.
* from a 2.3 liter 4 giving both great gas mpg and huge performance partly due to the direct injection - runs much cooler, and allows them to put the intercooler on top of the engine and route the ram air into a sealed box around it just like old muscle cars.
"
186,2007,kia,rio,5.2,3.7,15,14,"* The cars are cute and fuel efficient, but not dependable and Kia does not stand behind their product!Drives better on the highway than I thought it would for a small car-I was pleasantly surprised at the lack of effect on the car when semi trucks passes me or I passes semi trucks-I expected to be pushed around on the road more than I wasReally love the Kia cars, we own two now, just bought a 2008 Spectra after purchasing a 2007 Rio 2 months ago, now we both have Kias and we love them.This is a sweet, fun to drive, ecomomical and good-looking little car.
* I knew the Kia would get good mileage and the long warranty was important, but I did not expect it would be so fun to drive.
* Great price, great car.This car gets great mileage and lots of room for the price.
* Overall, no one who has been in and seen this car can believe that it is a Kia and that it comes in at such a low cost.I love my Rio5, it's great on fuel and it handles the road like a BMW.
"
187,2007,mercedes-benz,r-class,5.1,3.6,38,36,"* Performs like a true diesel but if you put your foot on the gas there are some ponies under the hood to be discovered.Great family vehicle with lots of room and fantastic comfort when cruising on the highway.
* Performs like a true diesel but if you put your foot on the gas there are some ponies under the hood to be discovered.Great family vehicle with lots of room and fantastic comfort when cruising on the highway.
* Wouldn't have gotten it except for the diesel - great mileage, quiet and plenty of torque for running around town or passing on the highway.

"
188,2007,chevrolet,silverado_2500hd_classic,5.5,3.6,6,5,"* I currently still own a 2500hd classic with the old 4 speed automatic trans and under similar driving conditions cosistently gets 3.1 miles per gallon better fuel economy!
* Rides better than my SUV, gets better fuel economy (gotta love a diesel) and has all the same creature comforts.
* It has plenty of power and fuel mileage is acceptable due to the diesel and Allison 6 speed transmission.
* On the highway it does not ride as well as my wife's Suburban, but still much better than the other trucks I have.
"
189,2007,saturn,vue,5.7,3.5,68,51,"* Mileage varries but we get 25- 30 mpg depending on driving conditions.We have owned 7 Lesux ES's & 4 Rx's and got a VUE based on towablity...We are thrilled with the car in almost all aspects, it is fun to drive, handles very well, dent resistant sides, clever inside features and a pleasure to own.
* I love this SUV it rides fantastic, gas mileage is excellent, I fill up on Monday and I can run on that for way over a week, sometimes 2 weeks, I don't go all over the place, but I go here and there, I drive it, I just do not treat it very kindly so I get good service out of it.
* It's not as good looking as the other SUV's in it's class but so far it has been a good car.
* Love it!The hybrid Vue runs great and the gas mileage is 30mpg in local driving(26-35mpg range) The acceleration around town very good and improved to 10000 miles.
"
190,2007,mazda,rx-8,4.1,3.7,7,10,"* I find that it doesn't have the pick up that the RX7 had but it's still fun to drive and the fact that I can haul my children around and still have a sports car is just icing on the cake!Great fun car to drive.
* My daily commute is 33 miles round trip and I get around 17-19 MPG consistently which isn't bad, but it isn't great.
* It really is so much fun to drive that I have to contain myself from driving like a teenager, and it's really hard.
* The only problem is I can't get my wife out from behind the wheel and now must go back and buy her the Miata!!
"
191,2007,audi,q7,5.3,3.6,38,34,"* It handles like a sports car  seats are very comfortable  engine and ride are extremely quiet and smooth  luxury features such as MMI, bluetooth, rear camera, air suspension system, large sunroof and sunscreen, and rear hatch are very useful  and the electronic stability system really works - I felt very safe descending a steep, winding, icy road without having to use the brakes.
* The ""Quattro"" system is the best four wheel drive system of any make of automobile in my opinion.I've been driving an A6 for seven years and wanted to upgrade to an A8, but the price point was more than I wanted to spend, so the Q7 was a great alternative - A8 size and comfort with the A6 price tag.
* I'm a 27 year old father and when I had to drive the R-350, I didn't enjoy it, because it looked like a minivan and it wasn't fun to drive.
* Our mistake, please don't make the same one.I have owned about 26 cars in my life and several Audis, but this is by far the most complete package, fun to drive, comfortable, well made, vehicle I ever owned.
"
192,2007,toyota,sequoia,5.2,3.6,11,10,"* I've had my Sequoia for a little over two years now and though I love driving the vehicle and it works well for my family of five, I am 15,000 miles past my manufacturer's warranty and already have over $2,000.00 in repairs.
* It is a sharp SUV and we are looking forward to taking it on our first road trip soon.I've always been a skeptic about the performance of our Toyota Sequoia, but after a recent car accident I can't imagine a safer car.
* I really overall love this car and expect to still be driving it in 10 years!As a confirmed Toyota hater, I was surprised at how much I liked this vehicle.
* It rides a little tougher than I'd hoped (on a smooth road it's great but where are those) but it doesn't jar your teeth loose and it's taut and quiet.
"
193,2007,honda,element,6.5,3.5,44,24,"* a 2004,(2)2005,(2)2006 and a 2007 we take the rear seats out and you can fit so much more equipment in them than our two Highlanders,We deliver equipment to construction sites so the all-wheel drive comes in handy as well, I like the new instrument illumiation over the others as well as the vehicle stability control,new seat belt location and side curtian air bags.I wanted an auto that my husband would hate!
* When will US car makers get on the ball?After test driving many SUV's I could not believe how this car could have the best road feel, since it's shorter then most of the ones I tested.
* Interior space and utility of overall vehicle unmatched by anything else out there.We bought a 2007 Honda element sc model silver, 18 inch mags sc package, right now it has a little under 6000 miles on it and its been in the Honda shop a total of 4 times.
* My friends love the back seat b/c they can see what's going on with the theater style seating plus it is really roomy in the back seat.
"
194,2007,ford,shelby_gt500,5.4,3.7,13,11,"* Because in 20 years 0 to 60 in 4.5 will still be fast...hold on!I am 53 years old and owned older Mustang muscle cars in the 60's and 70's but nothing like this car.
* I was one of the lucky ones who got mine at MSRP, but I can tell you that even at 1$0-15K over, I think it's worth the investment.This is the car that only Ford and Carroll Shelby could build.
* This is the one and only Ford I ever intend to own in my lifetime.If you have one of these beasts, you fall in love with it at first sight and it just gets better after that.
* Comparisons with the Z06 are a joke as this car's collector's status will be here long after the Z06's are in the junk yard.
"
195,2007,chevrolet,monte_carlo,5.8,3.6,14,10,"* This SS Monte does it all, no matter what the weather.I have been a long GM supporter starting back in the 70's with SS Chevelle's, Z28's, Impala SS and Monte Carlo's.
* Its fun to drive looks good, feels good is very dependable fuel economy is good comes standard with great optionsWe just bought our Monte Carlo and love it.
* What better car can there be then this car?It is a wonderful experience to drive a Monte Carlo SS because it has great horspower and the response to the acceleration is outstandingMy first SS.
* I am really impressed with this car and I'm sure anyone else who owns one would agree.I love my 2007 SS Monte Carlo, we just bought it this month.

* I hope you enjoy it if you decide to buy!Excellent performance - - 19 to 28 mpg - - stunning looks(black)- - it's a head turner, people comment on the vehicle I've owned 10 vehicles over the last 25 years and the CLS550 is unquestionably the biggest disappointment.

198,2007,mazda,mx-5_miata,6.3,3.7,34,20,"* Top down, windows up, heater on and a sunny day is ALL you need for Fun Fun Fun or should I say Zoom Zoom Zoom.
* Sure, I could have gotten something with more power, ""practicality"" or better handling specs, but none in this price range can match the Miata's quality, driver-vehicle connection, and fun factor.
* I'm hoping the company has a recall and they fix this - until then, it's the biggest bummer on such a FUN FUN FUN car!Just bought my Silver MX5 this past weekend.
* I never considered the Solstice because it's a GM product and I couldn't get over it's ""look at me"" flashy design.
"
199,2007,toyota,tacoma,5.8,3.6,65,48,"* Toyota needs to address this along with the 17"" sport wheels that have a pitting problem in the finish.I love my Tacoma  it's fun to drive and I think it gets better gas mileage than rated on freeway driving.
* There is no point in spending extra money for a Toyota if they are going to build them like Fords in California.I think the Toyota Tacoma V6 is great strong Motor and the 6 speed m/t works fine (I find the oil changes very easy to do, I love the location of the oil filter).
* Mileage is good for a 4x4, comfort is very good, power is good, and has plenty of pulling power for most drivers.This is my first Toyota and it is quite a change from my Ranger.
* Haven't towed the 4 horse trailer yet, but am sure it will perform.This is our fourth Tacoma since introducing Toyota to our ""Ford"" fleet some years ago.
"
200,2007,chevrolet,silverado_1500,6.3,3.6,89,52,"* Gas mileage isn't good, but hey, it's a truck!I absolutely love my new Silverado as do my wife and kids.
* I thought that since I had good results with gas mileage on the V6 that I thought the new trucks would get good mileage.
* Great handling and comfortI bought the 2007 Chevy Silverado, crew cab 315hp and it is by far the best pickup I have owned so far.
* I was extremely skeptical of the estimated 19 MPG highway, after owning the rig for over 2 years and 65,000 miles I dont find it far off I usually have a combined fuel average of 15.5+ at fill up!highway driving causes 3rd gear failure at 35K miles?
"
201,2007,buick,lucerne,3.9,3.5,34,53,"* If you are considering a Lexus E-350 or full size Chrysler Hemi, this car warrants a test driveLooked at Toyota Avalon and Ford 500, as well as the Lucerne but continued to go back to Lucerne and traded my 2003 LeSabre for the 2007 Lucerne CXL.
* My only complaint is the fuel mileage: I get 26 on the open road - not as good as the 29 I got with my 2000 LeSabre.Sometimes it feels like the only way I could get the gas mileage to be better is if I pushed it with the engine off!
* I love the way the Lucerne handles on a rainy road  however, the seats are not comfortable, the gas mileage is poor, the entry and exiting process is a torture for me at 6' 2'', and left turns and parking are a chore.
* Hopefully, the Buick will measure up in time, since gas prices are up.This is a great car to drive, very very quiet, great sound quality with the XM radio, CD, and IPOD.
"
202,2007,chevrolet,avalanche,6.1,3.6,58,37,"* It rides great, handles perfect, the stereo has great sound and bass and the fuel mileage is better than I expected.The 2007 Avalanche LTZ is a wonderful vehicle.
* Even my Mother (who has always hated trucks as ""the good car"") has told my Dad that he could buy an Avalanche to replace their Buick next year.This is my first Avalanche LTZ and I love driving this truck!!
* It's a great versatile vehicle, has near luxury car like ride with great styling and comfort.
* Makes the trip between Reno & LA a breeze.I've only owned this vehicle for a week but I can say that after driving the Nissan Titan and the Chevy Silverado, the Suburban based Avalanche has the best finished interior and best ride of the three vehicles.
"
203,2007,lexus,ls_460,4.4,3.5,28,35,"* I have owned a Lexus LS for the past 15 years and have recently purchased a new LS 460.
* Dollar for dollar, there is no other luxury car in its class that comes close to the Lexus LS 460.This is my 6th Lexus automobile and BY FAR the nicest and best riding I have ever had!
* Still have my 2001 LS 430, just had to have the LS 460, great power, good gas mileage.
* ).We have owned 5 Lexus cars and the LS 460 is the best in a grouping of cars that were all outstanding.
"
204,2007,ford,explorer_sport_trac,4.9,3.7,35,37,"* The Sport Trac handles great, it's quiet, the V6 gives me all the power I need, a really well balanced vehicle.
* I was really impressed with the Sport Trac's ride and inside headroom.just bought the new 07 Sport Trac-- what an improvement!
* I drive 52 miles to work every day, I previously owned a 2004 Sport Trac, the 2007 version is a much better vehicle, quieter, quicker, better handling and more roomy.
* I get between 22-24 MPG highway driving so that's better then what it is rated at.Sport Trac has plenty of room inside, and a very smooth drive which is good for long drive.
"
205,2007,toyota,highlander_hybrid,4.3,3.6,22,29,"* Overall, it's still a very well built car and fun to drive, if not fuel thrifty.I've been cringing when I read reviews from people saying that next time they'll go for a gas vehicle to get more ""umph"".
* It's not nearly as good on the gas mileage if you are on the highway riding over 75 mph or stomping on the gas around town.
* According to what I've read here, I would have still bought the vehicle, as most owners report better mileage, but why are some of us not, even though I drive carefully, do a lot of coasting etc.?
* It's comfortable and handles bumps better than my large SUV.Purchased the Highlander Hybrid and now have about 1100 miles on the vehicle.
"
206,2007,nissan,frontier,4.9,3.6,59,61,"* I've owned Dodge, Ford & Chevy but Nissan sincerely is the best thus far.I would agree with most of what I have read about this truck, I traded a 2003 ranger 4 liter,4wd, the ranger was 4:10 gears and would outperform the nissan in 1/4 mile, the nissan is quiet, good ride, eye appealing, nice and roomy compared to the ranger, seats take some adjustment to get right, console is short,mileage is about the same as the ranger (less than 20 mpg) I have been a Ford truck guy for years--so far I am pleased with the nissan.
* The six speed tranny boosts the fuel economy to 21-23. the other manufacturers better get it together if they are going to keep up with Nissan on this one!The Frontier crew cab has nice road feel - stable and solid, a comfortable ride and great space utilization options behind the driver seat.
* Frontier wins in power, ride, handling, refinement, etc.what a shame, a good truck except for horrible gas mileage and very scary abs braking on ice or snow, I will be getting rid of this truckA very well-built and nice looking truck, fun to drive, plenty of power.
* Love the sunroof, the Nismo sits very high, stereo is nice, mileage read out good, overall very happy.Looked at the Toyota Tacoma, Chevy Colorado, and Honda Ridgeline before buying my Frontier Crew Cab LE V6.
"
207,2007,hyundai,entourage,4.6,3.6,66,77,"* I only have 3000 miles on my van so hopefully it will start getting better mileage very soon.After owning 4 Hyundai's I've waited 10 years for them to bring out a minivan and they didn't disappoint me what a product.The standard features are second to none.The top warranty on the market how can you go wrong?.If you don't look at the Hyundai Entourage it will be your loss.This minivan is very responsive to the road and power all I can say is WOW!It does Move with a speedometer that goes to 130MPH can hardly wait till after the breakin period.You will think you are driving a sports car.The Premium Entertainment package makes you feel like you are in a Home Theater.Love the extra mirror to keep an eye on the kids and the radio controls on the wheel.This minivan to me is it!.after owning 4 different brands of mini vans, i have finally climbed to the top of the class.
* This van is gonna give Honda and Toyota a lot of competition!I am a previous Honda Oddessey owner for 4 years and really liked my van, however when it came time to trade in I just had to look at the new Hyundai Entourage, after driving it I was really amazed the fit & finish was excellent on power to the honda the refinement of the 3.8-250HP motor with 5 speed tran was smooth and powerful more so than my oddessey, the oddessey still get #1 for handeling but lets get releastic this is a mini-van Not a sports car, ride is far seperior to my oddessey for reliability I think that Hyundai's 10/100,000 WILL KEEP ME AT EASE.
* The styling, attention to detail, comfort and convenience as well as the larger engine and other features make this the best van ever!I traded in my wifes 2005 Toyota Sienna which had been brought back to the local dealer 5 times for a sulfar odor.After the last time I got it back with the same issue I decided enough was enough and traded it in for the Entourage.What a great minivan it gets 19 mpg compared to the Toyotas 13 I was getting along with heated leather seats 17"" aloy rime 4 wheel disc brakes traction control vsc fully power operated doors and trunk tri zone heat electroluminesent dash fog lights auto headlights and not to mention front side and curtain airbags.If you add all these features up on a similar Toyota or Honda be prepared to spend $40,000,What a great car I highly recomend to serious buyers.I am happyHyundai low cost, great styling, and high quality ratings are unbeatable.We own the 2006 Kia Sedona, fully loaded.
* We strongly believe Hyundai's reliability is better than the Janpanese made and we installed a hitch for our new trailer.I read 8/16th 2006 posting...having same problem...Entourage has been at dealer 12 days ..I ve owned car 20 days, Contacted Corporate and BBB autoline per warranty manual..This was the worst NEW car purchase ever..Stay away..They exchanged axle, tires & rebalanced tires & realigned steering...Still SHIMMY...Going back for 3rd visit..& pregnant 8 months..Like I have time for this AGGREVATION and drive back and forth do dealer...Enough is Enough..Hopefully they will take this back..I ve kept daily records...We shall seeJust purchased yesterday.

208,2007,chevrolet,colorado,4.0,3.6,18,27,"* Lastly, the hand-brake release needs to be better engineered since at times I have to pull, pull, and pull on the brake release handle.Enjoy the truck, could have power,feels solid, handles well, leather seats increases comfort, seats are larger, could be more back seat room, would prefere back seat to lay flatter that would give more room.well this is about mom and dad age 74- 76,mom had a few little problems like acid rain drops that wouldn`t come off- and she on one of her times in there (to shop) said something about the 5 speed not wanting to go into reverse...the reply was 2 peaces of paper that said--(A customer can expect a blocked reverse shift 10 in 50 attempts(1 in 5).Engineering has determined that this condition is a inherit characteristic(06-07) and should be considered NORMAL they give a procedure for getting it into reverse.1)shift into 1st gear 2)move vehicle forward 3)stop and shift to reverse.so that means you need to go into traffic to get it to reverse WRONG well i drive a stick and it (colorado) doesn`t workI really think GM could have kept the 2.2 instead of experimenting with more engines.
* Bought the truck to haul a lightweight trailer in the summer and get around town in the cold winter months So far no problems truck hauls well, drove to Texas last winter with 50 below weather with no problem Gas mileage better than the van we had before - cruising at 110Km we get 32 miles to the gallon Installed a cap on the back to keep items dryAll in all ownership has been all that I expected and more.
* The only repairs it has needed in 11,000 miles are a new driver's seat cushion (to fix loose upholstery) and a new HVAC control head (to fix a temperature knob that wouldn't go all the way).
* I'm averaging 250-270 miles on a 19.6 gallon tank.Since having the recall on the brake switch done I've have nothing but problems with my brakes locking up, ABS Faults and the dealship says it's not covered after 10k miles and that the recall did not cause it, and to fix would cost over $1500.

209,2007,chevrolet,uplander,3.4,3.6,11,21,"* The day after we purchased the Uplander, (by the way Red its the best color), we made a 400 miles trip, 2 adults, 2 kids and a lot of luggage.Great ride not a problem, in general terms it's a great car, nice power a lot of safety features and full equipment.Having minivans for the last 8yrs, this one is just another in a long line of vans.
* This morning as my wife put 1 of my 3 kids into the car and went to close the drivers side sliding door IT COMPLETELY FELL OFF AND HIT MY SON IN THE SIDE OF THE HEAD.The uplander is different than other vans.
* They dont know how to fix it-I am just stuck with it like that!The sliding doors close then pop back open!My wife and I bought this used van back in March and love it!
* Overall, a smash hit at my house!Out of 1 year I have owned vehicle, it has been in the service shop 6 times because of passenger sliding door problems.
"
210,2007,suzuki,forenza,3.8,3.5,14,23,"* I would not advise anyone to purchase this car, or you will be mad as hell the way that I am.I've had my 2007 suzuki forenza for a year and a half, since then,3 of my door handles have broke off, which i had to pay to replace, said they weren't under warranty, my transmission is slipping from drive to neutral,about wrecked the other day, going into shop on monday, paint came off all 4 wheels during a paid car wash, they said not under warranty, as they said transmission not under warranty as well, i bought this car with the feeling of not being broke down for a long time, i still owe 9,800 on it, I have taken extremely good care of my car, but it was so cheaply made its unreal, I feel suzuki should pay for the replacements of these parts, i would never recommand this car toanyoneI bought this car new.
* I've had my 2007 Forenza for a year now, it runs good and gets good gas milage but 2 of my door handles have allready broken off and i treat my car very good, both broke on the inside of the car, i think that this is a defect in the materials.
* And as for the other posts about the gas mileage, this car has phenomenal gas mileage.I just purchased my Forenza, and love the fact that it's a 5-speed manual.
* Don't waste your money no wonder they don't make these cars anymore.I love this car EXCEPT that the door handles have broken 3 times!!!
"
211,2007,dodge,nitro,4.5,3.4,65,78,"* Here are the problems I have had so far: park brake does not hold vehicle on slight incline unless you give it that extra little pull to the last notch, park brake boot zipper splitting 5 times dealer glued it closed & say that was chryslers fix, it split open the next morning), truck completely shut off while I was driving, roof rails lifted up, pass seat squeaks, a/c isn't very cold, can't roll up pass window from driver side, unlock switch actually locked all doors, seal on rear pass window replaced, tire press dings in cold temps, seat belt warning when no one in pass seat key fob issue when vehicle runningBought my nitro r/t June of 07 had only 2 months before I started having problems first the suspension was making noises the dealership acted like it was no big deal tried several things to fix didn't get it right until the third visit they said it was a body mass dampener as soon as I got the car back from the dealer a multitude of things started to act up plastic wheel coverings creaked when turning power steering pump making whistling noise had it back to the dealer twice on that they told me it was inherent to the vehicle and to contact Chrysler customer service instead I contacted lemon law atty.
* Everything else is fine and I'm impressed considering the price I paid.Just got the Nitro r/t 1mt ago for my wife we love this veh, had a 03 Cadillac CTS and by far this is a better vehicle to drive and just love the looks inside and out it will make heads turn as you drive by someone, We have had the Dodge Nitro for almost a year.
* It looks amazing, the inside has tons of room, the engine is a nice size with great pickup, yet quiet when driving, the interior has a great layout and is extremely comfy, and the free year of Sirrius doesn't hurt either.Bought the Nitro last week and It's really fun to drive.
* I'm a Chevy man but me and my wife love this thing and to the bad reviews, sounds like they should stay with there fords.. And leave Dodge alone they got everything under control with the nitro..I have had nothing but problems - rattling - power windows not working taillights go out now I have a noise when I tap my brakes the noise continues even if i am not applying brake my jeep had this same problem - interior is plastic - I have noticed transmission when shifting is problematic - This is such a fun vehicle to drive.
"
212,2007,mazda,mazda3,5.8,3.7,132,95,"* I've been getting fairly good gas mileage, I'm not really sure how the people reporting bad gas mileage drive but I try to keep it under 2 RPM which is about 55 mph in 5th gear, and I've been getting upper 20's low 30's on average with mostly in town driving.
* So far it seems like a great vehicle.i just got this little ball of fire 3 days ago and oh man this is the most fun I've ever had driving a car.So far i love my car.
* I highly recommend this car for any person ready to ditch their gas guzzling SUV and who wants to drive a fun little buggy that gets great gas mileage, and that's big on style and bang for the buck!
* On the other hand if I drive it like a sports car and stomp on the gas which makes the RMP's jump up.I knew going into this vehicle that it would not get as good of gas mileage as other vehicles in its class.
"
213,2007,ford,f-150,4.6,3.7,38,44,"* Would never buy a Ford truck again.This is my 2nd new F150 in 4 yrs, just love this trucks everything from the Power to Design both exterior and interior.
* Ford's F150 is reliable, handles well, gets decent mileage and is very comfortable.
* Do yourself a favor and get the bigger truck, it's there if you need it!The 07 Ford F150 is a very well built truck.
* the last on I drove 176,000 miles and cost me about 800.00 in repairs, I think this one pulls better and rides better looked at all models and stuck with Ford.Having owned nothing but Nissan, Toyota, and Honda for the past 30 years, I never thought I would own an American built truck, but here I am in this new Lariat and I've got to say, I've been pretty impressed.
"
214,2007,suzuki,sx4,5.4,3.5,44,37,"* This in itself would be acceptable BUT Suzuki will not assist in assuring I have a vehicle to drive while my car is being serviced and the dealership isn't going to use the courtisy shuttle to drive me 60 miles to my home so I am basically left stranded and praying the vehicle issue can be resolved in one day.
* Everything from the awesome drive to the ambiance, this is a very very good car and it is backed up by excellent service.This fun to drive vehicle has a solid, sturdy feel that is equally good to drive in the city or at high speeds on the open road.
* If that concerns you, look elsewhere, but if you want a fun and functional AWD crossover, this is it.We live in the mountains at Lake Tahoe and drive a lot through the snow and over the passes so we need a car with AWD, good gas mileage, and able to haul our gear around.
* I did a ton of research waiting for the right vehicle to be produced...for quite a few years might I ad....a small SUV, with ample interior space, comfort, small engine with adequate power, nice ride, looks, 2WD, AWD, and 4WD(mine has all three which I don't see anyone really talking much about - I have one of the first built-do they all still have this feature..?
"
215,2007,ford,fusion,5.6,3.7,80,64,"* I have never been a fan of Ford, but this Fusion has changed my mind.I bought the Fusion without ever seeing one in person and I really love this car.
* Ford has really impressed me on the design of the fusion it really does handle like a european car I have upgraded wheels and tires that make for a great look on a inexpensive fun car.
* If you are looking for a car that is fun to drive and looks great, you should at least give the all-wheel drive Fusion a test drive.
* So why would anyone pay more for a Honda, my Fusion is one of the best ideas I've had in a long timeTaut, well put together, quiet, big back seat, zoomy, 23 mpg combined city / highway, great sound system, smooth-shifting SIX speed automatic transmission, six air bags, etc.
"
216,2007,mitsubishi,raider,5.4,3.7,7,6,"* The look & style caught my attention as well as the price, but don't get e wrong looks aren't everything.
* I was in the market to buy one again, the size always seemed perfect, but I don't like the styling of the new Dakota.
* My truck was stickered on the lot for $17.9K.Was looking for a Dakota but like others did not like the new front end.
* If you need a big but nimble midsize to tow with and were waiting for the right price like I was, find a Raider SE.The last truck I owned was a 1997 Dodge Dakota.
"
217,2007,gmc,sierra_2500hd,6.7,3.6,10,5,"* I say to all who are interested, The new GMC Sierra is an awesome truck, with plenty of power to do what ever you would like!The GMC is a replacement for my stolen '03 Ford F-250 Powerstroke.
* Great truck!At first I didn't like the styling, because it looks like a Ford.
* control, leather power bucket seats keeps comfort at the front in this vehicle.I would highly recommend this truck to anyone wanting muscle and comfort.
* Why GMC chose to put highway tires on a HD truck is beyond me, but after slipping and sliding my way through a snowy and muddy New Mexico winter, and with only 6200 miles on the tires, I replaced them with Michelin M/S.
"
218,2007,bmw,6_series,7.1,3.4,12,5,"* The car has enough ""sporty-ness"" to feel like a performance car, but without the harshness or diminutive stature of so many other ""sports cars"" (I'm 6'3"" and 250 lbs).
* However, it does well getting on the freeway (30-70mph) It does not compare very favorably to a 911 Porsche, but it competes well with the SL 500 Mercedes.The 650 has what BMW calls an ""inherent characteristic.""
* Thats the reason i purchased a $80,000 car on the first place, insane.I looked at every ""similar"" vehicle - Porsche 911 and Cayman, SL-Class - but just couldn't find the right fit.
* If you drive in ""manual"" shift mode the vehicle is prone to stuttering when coming to a stop.
"
219,2007,cadillac,escalade,5.1,3.4,38,37,"* To anyone who is looking for a luxury SUV, this is the vehicle for you!The 2007 Cadillac Escalade looks great and drives great.
* I can't praise this SUV enough.Yeah the 2007 Cadillac Escalade is pretty much a great vehicle.
* So if you're looking for a luxury SUV with the heart of a sports car this is the buy for you.The 2007 Cadillac Escalade is one teriffic vehicle.
* And one great feature that this truck has that I have not seen on any other cars is the intellibeam system which puts the highbeams on when it pitch black, this is great for turnpike driving when there's oncoming vehicles.
"
220,2007,saturn,sky,5.1,3.5,55,52,"* If you care about looks, speed/performance, and fun factor... get this car, if you care about impressing people with a logo/brand, go get a twice as expensive japanese or german car.The Saturn Sky is a fun car to drive!
* It's like driving from the cockpit of a fighter jet.The Sky is a blast to drive.
* For me though, it's a great change of pace after driving a big SUV (which I still have, had to keep it, Sky can't haul anything except two people) for the last 9 years.
* Anyway, my 2007 still looks like a million bucks in the garage.I also have a Lincoln Towncar and I would rather drive my Saturn Sky any day, but being I live in Mich I store it during the winter.
"
221,2007,toyota,tundra,5.8,3.6,137,98,"* I had to have the radio replaced at 5000 miles and now at 6000 miles the transmission is acting strange.It is downshifting when coming to a stop, will have this checked at the 10000 mile service if it dosnt get worse before then.The truck has great power and give a smooth ride on the highway.Overall build quality is good to above average.I had my brand new 2007 Tundra for less than 5 days before the vehicle stability control failed, along with traction control and anti-lock brakes.
* This truck has ridiculous power but should really have a Lexus badge on it because the ride quality is second to none.Overall the Tundra is Okay, they have fianlly matched the big 3 in terms of lower quality, this is my 4th Tundra and the worst one thus far.
* Great job Toyota!If you wanna turn heads with the truck's sharp looks and impress passengers with its raw power, buy a tundra withthe 5.7L V8.
* Was hesitant to buy anything other than a domestic but couldn't pass on this truck.The Tundra's interior materials aren't as nice as the Tacomas, but it is still as good as any other domestic.
"
222,2007,chrysler,pacifica,6.0,3.3,59,39,"* The power from the 4.L seed automatic is better than you can imagine, and best of all the the great fuel mileage, we get 22 mpg in stop and go and have got as high as 26 mpg.What happens when you have to haul two 6'tall teenagers plus two friends and all their assorted hockey bags in a Pacifica??
* I'm seriously in love!I bought this vehicle because my wife and I wanted a vehicle with a 3rd row that wasn't a mini van and got better than 20 mpg.
* I am pleased, perhaps paid a littl too much but love love love the car.I have owned my Pacifica for almost two years and it has never had to go back to the dealer.
* Plenty of power with new 4.0 engine and the new 6 speed transmission with AWD and having 6 adults on board.I have had my Pacifica about two months.
"
223,2007,mazda,mazda6,6.1,3.7,41,26,"* It isn't that expensive, you get over 30 mpg, it's a whole lot of fun to drive, it looks cool, it's safe.
* The Mazda 6 i Sport Value Edition is the perfect car for buyers who want 4-cylinder gas mileage but don't want to sacrifice good looks, performance and comfortability.
* Excellent reliability for a good price.Fun car to drive,looks cute,sporty handling,however seats squeak horribly since day one, paint chips and scratches easily,interior doesn't hold up well-seats and dash trim,gas mileage- max 28mpg hwy driving no more than 65 mph.
* You get a great handling car with good gas mileage for a great price.
"
224,2007,ford,focus,5.6,3.7,74,57,"* For a small car, it is very fun to drive and it let's me pass the gas pumps giving good gas mileage.
* Would definitely recommend this car to someone looking for a good handling, fun to drive, and good gas mpg car!2007 SES sedan 5MT.
* If one is looking for a commuter car that offers great mileage , the Focus is a great choice.I had a 2000 Focus and traded it in on a van for the wife and kids.
* The Focus carries a ton of stuff, 2 9 foot plus boards on top, is very fun to drive, and gets decent gas mileage (25 to 30 mpg with the PZEV).
"
225,2007,mitsubishi,eclipse_spyder,5.7,3.7,37,28,"* Plus, you get 6 gears with the Mitsubishi and 5 with the American models.What's more is there to say about the 2007 Eclipse Spyder than it's Fast, Fun, and Exciting to drive!
* The eclipse has tons of power and torque, a great sound system, and IMO unique but great styling.This is my third Eclipse Spyder.
* If you're in the market for a convertible check out the Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder, you won't be disappointed!I owed an Eclipse Spyder in the past and I loved it.
* This car is so much fun to drive, a little more room than a conventional two-seater, handles corners great, the wind doesn't knock it around and the top is much quieter than my Mustang convertible GT was.
"
226,2007,ford,ranger,5.1,3.7,21,20,"* I still couldn't imagine myself in any other vehicle - Ranger's ""perfect fit"" size, tossable handling, excellent ergonomics and (so far) bullet-proof quality make this truck a clear winner for me!
* With a $14,100 drive out price it's a great deal.Just purchased my shiny new Ranger Sport Supercab this past Sunday.
* While far from the most modern or refined choice on the market, for anyone looking for a ""real"" and wholly usable little pick-up that, well equipped, won't break the bank - Ranger certainly warrants a look.
* Body is okay but a little to much plastic for my personal liking.I recently brought a Ford Ranger Fx4 level 2 due to its low price and standard options on the vehicle.
"
227,2007,volvo,xc70,4.3,3.8,6,8,"* I thought there was not comparison between the Volvo and the Outback....I know the Outback has a good reputation, but the XC70 has blown me away (imagine moving from a 1993 4-runner to a 2007 XC70).
* I would recommend Volvo to anyone looking for a life-saving vehicle.The XC70 is a beautiful legend.I owned this wagon for about 9 months and made about 16,000 miles.
* Also have had repeated problems with the tire pressure monitoring system--car has been back 3x for service--each time, they tweak, but warning message comes on after 30 minutes on highway.
* I have 26K miles on it already and not one issue yet!Only owned vehicle for 3 months, Applied winter tire package.
"
228,2008,volkswagen,passat,6.0,3.6,53,35,"* If you are in the market for a wagon or sedan, once you test drive this car, the competition just won't look as appealing because the driving dynamics and handling on the Passat our so much better.This car had the drivability to almost instantly take me out of the Japanese market over such brand as Honda and Toyota.While those cars are good the VW instantly sets itself apart with the performance and safety features you get as standard equipment, while with Toyota and Honda you have to pay extra for these features.
* Also the car seems to have a stronger feel to it, not just in the engine but overall the handling feels tighter, there is less road noise, even the doors feel like they actually have some meat to them.That's probably why it does so well in the crash ratings.Overall I just feel like I got more for my money with vehicle and I look forward to my next one in another four years.I absolutely love my Passat.
* Cool factor aside, the SUV gives me lower MPG, more money for insurance, traditionally rollover prone, not as sporty to drive, typically not great in the rain... My new wagon is awesome, first tank of gas 29 MPG, try that in a Mid/Small SUV at $4.50/gallon for gas!This is our 3rd VW.
* It's a german engineered car made to perform and for it to perform it needs good fuel... with that said the car is great and so was my last VW so I plan to stick with them.After driving the Subaru Outback and Forester, the Volvo XC70 and V50, the Mazda 6 and looking at an Accord, a Camry, a Prius, and an Altima, we settled on this well-appointed, modestly priced, fun-to-drive, versatile wagon to replace our well-loved 10-year-old Honda Accord LX sedan.
"
229,2008,toyota,land_cruiser,6.4,3.6,7,4,"* My previous vehicle was 2004 Totoyo Sequoia which was also great, but the Land Cruiser is the better one.
* My experience with this vehicle is limited (500 miles), however what a great, powerful, solid, comfortable, well-built, technologicially superior, cutting edge, handsome ""BEAST"".
* To me the 08 is worth every penny.This is my 5th land cruiser and the very best.
* Would like to see front console cup holder lighting for night time driving and overhead spotlight buttons lit also.
"
230,2008,volvo,c30,5.4,3.8,25,21,"* I feel amazing knowing I haven't seen one of the C30's on the road since I first noticed them back in January!!
* And let's not forget ergonomic seats (great on long drives) and good trunk space, especially with seats down - fit a massage table, luggage for two, gifts and a large reclining beach chair no problem!wanted a safe car (after an accident), discovered C30.
* One added benefit is the fact you don't see many of them on the road (yet) so it stands out in the crowd.I struggled between getting a Mini Cooper S and this car, and couldn't be happier with my choice.
* Chose the 2.0 for styling and audio reasons.I read all the reviews and test drove several small hatchbacks before selecting the Volvo C30 (with only one option - automatic transmission).
"
231,2008,lexus,gx_470,5.3,3.5,8,7,"* We love the luxury ride, the look, the amenities, the comfort, and the regular mountain driving is superb.
* But when I got into GX, I knew right away, its a match made in heaven.After driving a Durango for many years, we wanted something a little nicer but still powerful enough to keep up our active outdoor lifestyle.
* Used to drive an Infiniti Q45 that was an excellent vehicle but not enough room, my wife drives a Honda Pilot, which I dread to drive because of intolerable road noise.
* It's a phenomenal piece of machinery and if you love the 4runner, the GX 470 will put it to shame and make you wonder why you ever drove one!
"
232,2008,saturn,vue,4.9,3.5,76,79,"* Never thought we would buy a crossover SUV past 3 vehicles have been Buicks and loved each one - couldn't find a new one we liked at a price we wanted so on a whim we stopped at Saturn to look at the Aura - didn't like that but the Vue was sitting there and when we got in it we feel in love with the interior - took it for a test drive and was very surprised at how well the ride and handling was - very quiet ride - smooth sifting - plenty of power with the V6 - Searched hard for something in this size category.
* I cannot imagine owning another SUV and I would highly recommend the Saturn VUE to anyone.I have had my 2008 Saturn VUE XR Front wheel drive since June 2008, and LOVE it!
* Finally found myself in a Saturn dealer and was blown away with the VUE - near luxury drive, German engineering and design in and out, quality materials, handles well and 4 cyl.economy - no it is not a luxury car but comes darn close for the price!I love my VUE!
* Overall, good buy for small SUV buyers out there, and it was the first American car I had bought in years!This is my third and probably last Saturn.
"
233,2008,ford,shelby_gt500,3.2,3.7,9,19,"* If I hear a complaint about this car I just figure it's either somebody who's never driven one, or somebody who can't (or won't) get one.
* I grew up in the 60's and 70's, road in and drove the fastest cars of the day-Shelby GT 500's, Charger 440 6- packs, SS 396 Chevelles etc.
* A Brit, lived in US for 8 years, could not afford a Mustang in UK, bought a new GT in 06 & just loved this American Icon, traded for GT500 in July 08 & wow!, Here's a bit of plagiarism from the UK's ""Top Gear"" auto review TV program ""Floor the throttle and the big V8 talks to you, roaring and whistling, the gearbox rattles under load and the axle whines and moans.
* I have since owned other performance cars including Corvette's, Camaro's, Saleen's at 560hp.
"
234,2008,cadillac,escalade,3.8,3.4,9,15,"* This is my 10th new Cadillac purchase in a row.I love the Truck, The most impressive thing is the power, it moves, drives very smooth , the NAV is great very easy to follow, I traded up from a Ford Expedition..there is no comparison, this CADI is unreal, I test drove every SUV , the Range Rover and all, testes the CADI last and was sold instantly, Just go drive one!
* It's fun to drive and does exactly what I expected when I bought it - looks great, drives great, and hauls as a big rig!Decided on the 08 AWD Escalade after test driving the 08: MDX, GL320 & 450, Q7, Range Rover Sport, X5, & Sequoia Platinum.
* Don't get me wrong, looks great tons of room but it drives like a mack truck and it feels like something is going to break when you go over a bump.
* I also own a 2007 Range Rover HSE with luxury package, and it's a great truck, but Escalade platinum is unbelievable.

"
236,2008,kia,sorento,4.8,3.7,14,15,"* Have to remove the rear seat headrests in order to put the back seat down, with all of the rear seat headrests & seat belts crossing in my view in the rearview mirror you do not get a clear view out the back, nice storage under the rear floor, but you have to remove EVERYTHING from the back of the vehicle to access it.
* REALLY WISH I had returned it & gotten my old vehicle back.My Kia is fun to drive, handles like a dream, I just wish the passenger side airbag sensor light wouldn't come on when there is someone in the seat.
* Seat back is great for my back I never took proper care of...Even though its been just 1700 miles I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised about this SUV.
* If Kia could get a better stereo, nav option and work on the gas mileage, this would be the best SUV in its class.

238,2008,chevrolet,silverado_2500hd,4.5,3.6,10,12,"* I have a HD plow it it works fine.Have an on going problem when trying to plow with this truck.It loses amperage so bad I can not pick the plow up until I shut the truck off and wait a bit before restarting.They put on a new voltage regulator,new computer etc.When the mechanic called the GM rep and discussed this with him he said there was nothing wrong.I make a living with my truck and have had 12+ Chevys over the years with no problems,this is ridiculous.I feel I am being pushed aside because they dont know whats wrong yet.Solid truck with lots of power.
* I tow a 8000lb travel trailer and this think tows it like a tank and I love it.I love my new diesel.
* My brother has the Dodge and I feel that the motor in the Chevy feels much more refined.I have always been a Ford guy, but when shopping for the F250 versus Silverado 2500, I thought the Chevy had a better ride, a nicer interior, a the dealer was very aggressive in terms of pricing.
* My only complaint is the new emmissions equipment really chokes this thing and kills mileage  I get 14 in town and 18 highway with some modifications.
"
239,2008,chevrolet,silverado_1500,6.1,3.6,54,35,"* it was fixed under warranty.Truck is great, for those of you worried about MPG, i got to 13000 and finally started to see much Much better gas mileage.
* The fuel mileage was great while I was watching it but it drove my girlfriend nuts so I stopped (took it off instant miles per gallon) since then my avg fuel mileage went from 16.5 to 15.8 so watching what you're doing while driving helps slow stops and gradual speed take offs does a lot.
* I get on average 400 miles a tank on 30 gallons, not to great or bad for a V6, i love my truck im 6'6 and i can fit in it just fine , GM is still a great company.
* Active fuel management doesn't really seem to work.I owned 4 of the old body style Silverado and thought they were nice driving trucks but the new 2008...nice truck!
"
240,2008,bmw,7_series,6.4,3.4,9,5,"* Tested another 750li before buying this one - and it had a broken sunshade.Overall it's just a great car, rides well, always works as it should, Once you get to know iDrive it's a good system but not great, quality fit and finish inside and out, comfortable on the highway, in traffic, or on the twisty back roads.
* In my opinion this car is the best in this class as far as options, interior look, feel, drive and build quality is concerned.
* So much for my purchase of the ""luxury"" car when I am driving a loner most of the time.I had only considered another S500 or the Lexus LS460 L. I stopped in at the BMW dealer while the wife was shopping just to kill time.
* After the negative notes on the iDrive and a look I considered ""not cool"" I was impressed with the close-up look of the exterior and blown away by the interior.
"
241,2008,ford,fusion,6.3,3.7,65,38,"* Wanted to stay with Ford as the Fords I've owned in the past have never given me issues so the Fusion was the logical choice as a ""step up"" Went with the AWD model because the weather up here in Canada tends to vary widely and in Canada only the SEL trim has the AWD option.I traded my 2004 Audi A4 for my Fusion and don't regret it one bit.
* I now have 1,200 miles on it, and the car has not developed any rattles or squeaks.As a foreign car fan I must say  for the dollar Fusion is the best deal, If you want a Camry or Accord and are willing to pay almost $30k then the Fusion is not in your market.
* I test drove a number of cars on the market, including the Accord and Altima, and came back to the Fusion, as it has a ride very comparable to the Camry, and the interior is much better than the Camry's....much more comfortable.
* Couldn't get the Honda dealer to give much discount on the Accord, but got a great deal on the Fusion.
"
242,2008,toyota,highlander_hybrid,6.1,3.6,36,23,"* Gas mileage in the mid-20s, which isn't great, but good enough to still feel superior that I'm driving a hybrid :)The thing that makes the 2008 Highlander Hybrid is the gas electric meter so you can monitor your gas/electric use.
* Too bad you can't put the child seat in the center and have two 2nd row passengers (seat belt interferes) So far about 24mpg... lots of breaking in leftSince purchasing our Toyota Highlander Hybrid in December of 2007, we've driven nearly 9,000 miles.
* I'm very pleased with it.We traded our 2005 Highlander Limited with 65,000 miles for an '08 Highlander Hybrid and went from average 21 mpg to average 26 mpg, more performance, more room and comfort.
* I am not saying its a bad vehicle, but don't believe your salesperson that u are going to get 26 MPGWe just leased our 2008 highlander hybrid and currently have 800 miles logged.

243,2008,kia,sportage,6.5,3.7,22,12,"* Not small guy was going to get Cadillac but not enough difference to make the addl $$ worth it.My sportage was a leftover 2008 and i bought it feb 2009 i was very happy with the warranty and the rebate of 4000 .i will never go back to gm after owning a kia.it handles good on the road ,and in the snow and ice.only complaint i have is that the front seats need to have arm rest.My sportage was a leftover 2008 and i bought it feb 2009 i was very happy with the warranty and the rebate of 4000 .i will never go back to gm after owning a kia.it handles good on the road ,and in the snow and ice.only complaint i have is that the front seats need to have arm rest.I wanted a midsize SUV after always having sedans, but wanted something good on gas, and a good warranty.
* I really love it, it's a alot of car for a low price and an awesome warranty!Update from my first review- Have had vehicle for 10 months now and STILL love it!
* Due to rising gas prices, we recently went on the lookout for a better commuter vehicle and, while impressed with the looks and mileage of the Kia compacts, we went right back to a new Sportage.
* I was 9 months pregnant and was having a VERY hard time getting the infant car seat in and out of the back seat of my 04 honda ex coupe, so I was just looking around for a 4door vehicle at least.
"
244,2008,mitsubishi,raider,6.4,3.7,7,4,"* Love setup, love the comfort and looks and love the height, I have a ram 4x4 with 3"" lift and the raider is only an inch or so shorter on height then my 3"" lifted ram, so love that.
* For the price and what I get in return, this vehicle is a good option.I purchased my raider in 2006 brand new and after a while I took it upon myself to improve the fuel economy by installing a cold air intake kit that brought me up to getting as much as 24 mpg on the highway and about 19 in the city.
* The ride is great and comfortable, she's fun to drive and I am going to upgrade it with more parts to help make her more fuel efficient and fun to drive by switching to a performance exhaust and higher performance spark plugs and cables which will be an inexpensive yet effective upgrade.
* Had it to do over, would not buy one with the v6 would opt for the v8- then price wise- a Silverado or Ford with a v8 would be cheaper and more comfortable inside.
"
245,2008,nissan,pathfinder,4.8,3.6,32,35,"* )I've been reading everyone's reviews about the engine clunking at around 40 mph and I'm having that same problem with my vehicle, I'm afraid that this car isn't gonna last too long with the engine being the way it is, they need to recall this year vehicle, I knew I should've bought a Toyota but I wanted something with more power which this vehicle has as well as great features but if the engine isn't gonna last that long, I'm trading it in for a Toyota, I know Toyotas last a long time as far as the engine goes.I traded a 2004 Isuzu Rodeo S for my '08 Pathfinder so right off the top I was immediately impressed.
* It has a lot of nice touches both inside and out and I have absolutely no buyer remorse!Had an 05 Off Road, Never had a problem,after 56K and several trips to ski in Colorado, traded it in for a 08 LE V8 very happy, great acceleration, good handling, love the audio system it's fully loaded back-up camera, fuel etc.
* Now to more details on my experience with the pathfinder - the driving experience is great, interiors have a plush feel, rear view is awesome, sound system is good and overall car experience has been great.This vehicle is very nice, but the windows when brought down a little while driving makes a lot of rattling noise/sound which is very disgusting.
* I'll probably go back to a smaller car or wagon next time given the price of gas.I don't know why I bought it in the first place - it just had everything I needed at the time (7 passenger and still had storage room).
"
246,2008,volkswagen,touareg_2,5.2,3.6,11,10,"* This is an utterly awesome car, you really have to test drive one to fully appreciate it, do it at night, you'll be truly blown away!Be prepared to replace the tires on this vehicle approximately every 20,000 miles due to the weight of the vehicle and possibly to its design.
* It's a must to test drive suv.I have owned several SUVs, Honda CR-V, Jeep Liberty, Nissan Murano and the Touareg is the best SUV I have owned so far.
* VW is great but I would recommed the extended if you will keep for more than 5 years.Have driven my Touareg 2 around 2500 miles, mostly highway, and I'm very happy with the car.
* I finally opted for the touareg because it's fun to drive, the 4WD is phenomenal in snow and the back window is straight so you don't loose 50% of the trunk space with the back window that is at a 45 degreee angle.After looking at Lexus, X5, Cayane, MDX, and the Audi.
"
247,2008,dodge,caliber,4.4,3.4,34,44,"* Overall, I think its a good buy based on price.This is my second Caliber...I have 8,950 on the clock and it is running great..It does need a little gas of the lights but once it gets going it's great.feels solid.no bodyroll in the corners.The driving view is good.except the large front pillars..you need to really check.they are quite intrusive..and do obstruct the view.i found adjusting the height in my seat to be better.The interior seems better than my 2007 model.everything is within easy reach no annoying digital readouts.easy to drive.the gearbox is good.bit slow at start but flies on motorway.good power for overtaking and the car seems solid whilst making quick maneuvers..all in all the Caliber is fun to drive.no problemsI had to give up my Suburban for a more economical vehicle and plus a lower monthly payment.
* I just recently purchased my caliber and all I can say is this little machine is a blast to drive and gets great gas mileage to boot.
* The seats were comfortable on the drive, it fit everything in it that we needed, we didn't even notice any road noise with the awesome stereo on (oh & to those of you complaining about not being able to see title & names on the radio/Sirius all you have to do is press the ""info"" button & it shows that stuff)...all in all this is a great car2.0 with CVT trans.
* If you're looking to get a caliber they're nice but I strongly recommend you do not get one and look into something elseI just bought my 2008 Dodge Caliber April 28,2008 and I will tell you this car is the smoothest car I have ever driven in.
"
248,2008,infiniti,ex35,5.2,3.6,38,35,"* It's so much fun to drive, however there's a few things I would have like to see: less wind noise, more back seat room, easier control (it takes you a week to figure out how everything works.
* I did knowingly downsize - the back seats and back are much smaller than the EX and would not be comfortable for adults to sit in back seats for long drives.
* It's a fun car to drive, and I have plenty of room for my needs (I didn't want a big gas guzzling SUV).Have about 3700 miles on car and love it.
* After 2 weeks of ownership I am really pleased with the decision.I have a lot of reviews on the EX35 and some people just don't like this car but we love driving our EX!
"
249,2008,mazda,mx-5_miata,5.6,3.7,30,24,"* Given the fact that this cars reliability and ""fun to drive"" factor is what really matters it's hard to beat the basic sport, with the power top.
* Popping the top down in 3 seconds for the drive home on a sunny day is priceless.Bought the car in late February in Michigan-couldn't really drive it until late March.
* Fun to drive!What a lot of fun to drive.
* The drive is great and I'm getting about 35 mpg on windy mountain roads in Colorado I drive every day.
"
250,2008,toyota,corolla,6.0,3.6,37,25,"* I wish I had test driven the car when it was cold, before I accepted this car for delivery.From my first test drive, I knew that's going to be my car, I really like the way it is to drive, I love the look, the design everything, You can see the high quality of Toyota on this car, I really recommend this car.This is a great car for the money specifically for gas mileage.
* I look forward to drive this car.We love the ride and gas mileage of our 2008 Corolla S. The big negative though is exactly like another owner stated if you do not warn this vehicle for at least 10 minutes in the winter the car has a lot of PISTON SLAP.
* Other than this noise my Corolla runs great 28 mpg in town, 325 miles to tank of gas of 12.5 gallons.
* Acceleration is a bit disappointing on highway, but once cruise speed is attained has no problem reaching 90 mph, and sounds and feels quite smooth.S type Corolla has a much more interesting look to it, for those who are knocking the ""plain"" look of the Corolla, the S package doesn't add much in price but adds a body kit and rear spoiler to jazz it up a bit.
"
251,2008,mercedes-benz,clk-class,9.1,3.6,20,2,"* The power is there when you need it.The handling is great.The braking is great.Above all you feel safe in this car.I have no complaints about quality.It's all built in.I'm holding on to this one.It's the first of my future collection.Great car, sound system is great, great acceleration.

* As having a great affinity for cars especially coupes this one has it allThis coupe will turn you into a racecar driver.IT has the same engine as the S class with a fraction of the price.This car really has it all, from it's 8 cyinder engine to it's body sculpted desing that has AMG written all over it.
* The AMG Performance Studio really outdid themselves when the produced this wonderful example of their capabilities.This coupe will turn you into a racecar driver.IT has the same engine as the S class with a fraction of the price.This car really has it all, from it's 8 cyinder engine to it's body sculpted desing that has AMG written all over it.
"
252,2008,nissan,350z,4.6,3.6,11,13,"* I'm looking into awdI had a flashy red 2005 350Z ('til hubby wrecked it on a slick road I was given the chance to 'trade-down' from my '07 350Z Roadster Touring (equipped) for a new '08 Nismo ""even""///What a difference in handling, speed and fun..it is everthing my old '75 280Z had accentuated to the highest level and then some..The Nismo is for driving and I'm sure would be fun to punish at a track  however, I just like driving it 0-60 (or so) and enjoying the car's superb cornering and acceleration capabilities...I agree with the review about the stereo being poor  but when I put my I-pod adapter in, the stereo was much better..as the speakers 'break-in' the sound improves too...meanwhile I'm just smiling and driving this car more 'happily' than the convertible!The 350Z has all it takes to be an excellent peformance and economical sports car!
* Everytime you get in it feels like your going to an auto X. I test drove an STI, G35, and RSX's before I found this, and I beleive it is the fastest and best handling out of the 3.
* If you drive it smooth (which is VERY hard to do) you can get good mpg, but driving it like a true sports car can cause some frequent trips to the pump.
* However if you like that feeling of being connected to the road like me you will love this.
"
253,2008,dodge,avenger,4.8,3.4,55,60,"* I get so many comments on this car, better than I ever did on the 05 Mustang I owned, though I don't get the great gas mileage my 07 Sonota did, but it's not terrible.Fun to drive, handles well, very responsive, but the noisiest vehicle I have owned  engine has a slight whistle and it rattles over small bumps.
* Overall not a bad car, just not what I wanted.This car is great,style a true muscle car the deal I had gotten on this car was fantastic over 7500 off plus another 2000 for my trade and only 100 miles The car looks and rides great I average anywhere from 31 to 36mpg on the highway all the downfalls that Edmunds has said are not true I often catch myself cruising at 75mph with out even realizing interior is nice and very accessible my 14 year old son thinks the car is awesome and wants it in 2years when he starts to drive overall a great value I drove the honda accord and chevy and this is much better for room and performanceI fell in love with this car.
* It really is a great car to drive, it doesn't have the power of the beefier 3.5L Avenger, but the 3.5l isn't getting the great gas mileage either.
* This isn't a luxury car but it's reasonably priced, gets a ton of compliments, and is a pleasure to operate, plus the fuel economy is great.I bought this car with 14,000 miles on it 8 months ago.It has ample power and plenty of interior space.It has more than it's share of blind spots and a rather cheesy interior.
"
254,2008,volkswagen,gli,4.5,3.6,10,12,"* If you are looking at similar-sized sport sedans, then make sure you take a test-drive in the GLI, you WILL be converted.I have driven my 2008 GLI just over 5000 miles, including just over 3000 from Atlanta to San Francisco.
* Is the first car I've had that after two months I still can't wait to get behind the wheel.I leased my Black 6-speed manual GLI starting in March and absolutely love the car.
* I ended up purchasing the GLI since it was $10,000 cheaper than the Audi and handled better.I picked up my Black 08' GLI with manual transmission and the autobahn package this weekend and it has been a dream come true.
* It handles like the Audi A4 but $10,000 cheaper and better on the pocket book.While walking down the lot I noticed the GLI, test drove it and fell in love with the car and how it handled.
"
255,2008,volkswagen,gti,5.7,3.6,29,22,"* My husband has a honda si and that is a great car too but when I drive his car, I miss my GTI, I just love the instant turbo power you get when you step on the gas pedal, and you don't have to down shift to get that power.
* More sophisticated drive than the the MazdaSpeed3 with comparable performance and better looks (IMO).Compared this car with the Subaru Legacy, but settled on the GTI based on friend's recommendation and fun driving experience.
* I had the GTI for the past 3 weeks and is totally awesome, great driving experience and a great reason to get up in the morning and drive to work.
* Then one day my husband said go drive the VW GTI, well it was love at first test drive, I was hooked, the speed, the handling, the torque and it is a hatchback.
"
256,2008,toyota,tacoma,5.9,3.6,49,34,"* I would suggest the tacoma... but good luck.I finally sold my '91 Toyota Pickup for a new Taco after failing to find a used 4 cyl, manual, 2wd, extended cab one used for anywhere near a reasonable price.
* This truck rocks!This is my second Toyota Truck, but have owned several Toyota's (I was a Toyota Master Tech years ago).
* ).This is my first Toyota I trade 2004 Nissan frontier great truck and get this Toyota with only 350 miles it was 6 times in the dealer, engine has a ticking noise and is getting worse, the transmission make a bell noise when is on neutral, and also makes a clunk when go to full stop, the dealer said everything is normal.
* Hey, but it's paid for!I wanted a truck that would tow my trailer, get me into the back country, get good mileage, be reliable and dependable: what else but another Toyota!
"
257,2008,lexus,gs_350,5.9,3.5,17,12,"* As with my previous lexus, the build quality is excellent, and the car is just a blast to drive.After test driving Acura RL, BMW 535i, and Lexus GS 350 on and off the freeways and curvy roads, I found Lexus GS 350 to be a clear winner.
* Everything you could want in a luxury car!Sold our 2000 GS 300 for this 2008 GS 350, wish we had the GS 300 back.
* Excessive brake dust, small trunk, lack of leg room in back seat, difficulty in getting out of back, feeling that the roof is too close to my head, ride is rough when not on a smooth road, road noise when not on a smooth road.
* Driving Experience: Acceleration good (sometimes rigid transition)  I have the 18'' tires and you get a good feel for the road  Great turning radius  Interior is the best in class!
"
258,2008,toyota,camry,4.7,3.6,46,51,"* I never wanted to buy a camry before, they looked like your parents car, now they look like MY racing car.I've driven the Lexus 400 Series since 1991 and have just purchased a 2008 Toyota Camry SE V6, and the car is excellent.
* The Camry is overall a solid car and sure to please the masses.This is my fourth camry, I bought my wife an 08, because I liked her 05 so much but she wouldn't give it up, so I bought the 08 for her and now I'm driving the 05, both cars are 4 cyl, and have plenty of pick up.
* Put on about 2,600 miles the car road great.Trade-in time for 2003 Toyota Camry LE V6 we really liked except for a known Camry feature - choppy transmission.
* I have owned a 1993 Camry and a 2001 Camry, and this 2008 Camry is terrible compared to those two.
"
259,2008,nissan,versa,5.8,3.6,69,51,"* The Versa is a great car, built well, comfortable, great CVT, rides well, corners well and is all around a great product.
* The Intelligent Key is also a great feature!I don't drive far to work but it's a great car when I drive half way across the country to visit family.I did my research before I bought it, and haven't ever regretted the decision.
* I love driving it, gas mileage is awesome, looks sporty, the windows were already tinted, it's fully loaded, absolutely love it.Purchased this Nissan Versa in April, 2008 as a commuter vehicle.
* Excellent car and very fair priceWe've had our Versa for about 7 months and we LOVE it.We looked at all the others, and it was no contest.Classier and more substantial looking than the Fit or Yaris, almost identical in dimensions and capacities to the Vibe/Matrix but costing thousands less, the Versa is great bang for the buck.
"
260,2008,lexus,ls_460,4.7,3.5,17,19,"* I've owned a 1996 Lexus coupe, a 2001 LS 430, and now a Lexus LS 460.
* I don't see this small footrest complaint for 07, this car is simply the best.Just traded from years of driving BMWs and Mercedes for my first Lexus, the LS 460 with all the options except laser cruise.
* The LS 460 is smoother, slightly quieter and faster than my 2001 LS 430, although there is a little engine noise on low speed which I think is the current design.
* It seems that Lexus considered even the most minute details when they designed this car, in order to create a ride as close to perfect as possible!Previously owned a LS 430.

* ------------------------------------ - It has been fixed now but the rear hatch would sometimes open without any input from the remote.
* Now for the cons - terrible fuel mileage (averaging 11 mpg in NYC), it's a big truck so the drive isn't as sporty as my BMW SUV's.The 2008 GL320 CDI is the best MB I've yet owned, out of 4 different models.

"
262,2008,subaru,outback,5.9,3.7,55,39,"* If you don't like really ""driving"" your car, buy a Honda Accord.First 4500 miles impressions: good handling, comfortable, quiet, decent stereo, sufficient (not great) power, averaging 28 MPG.
* The car is great fun to drive.We had already decided to buy a 2008 2.5i Outback when I happened across an Outback on the dealer lot with a different badge on the back that said ""PZEV - Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle"".
* Wish it had better gas mileage, but I knew what I would get before I bought it, just did not know how much gas prices would rise.We looked at a number of small SUVs and wagons and went with the Outback for a number of reasons: comfort, MPG, and functionality.
* After test driving all the comparables, the Outback was the only one that fit the bill - reasonable gas mileage, good safety ratings, reliable, good roof rack for the surfboard, and can hold 25 bags of mulch in the back when needed.
"
263,2008,ford,f-450_super_duty,5.0,3.7,14,14,"* This truck is not one of Ford's better ideas.I have had my truck for 12 months, it has been in the shop 16 times for a little over 180 days but ford will not buy back!
* 14750 miles and 34 days in for repair - ABS problems, cooling problem, loss of power, light bulbs falling out, hub caps falling off, can only use 33 gallons max of the 38 gal tank, 5.1 MPG towing 10,000lbs, 80MPH max speed..
* When I hit 15,000 miles the mileage took a jump to 9.5 mpg towing and 14 mpg empty (driving at 70 mph with 4.88 gears).
* I have 4.10 gears in it I'm looking to swap them out for some 3.73's to get better mileage, if I can get the thing out of the shop!I am a car hauler.
"
264,2008,mitsubishi,eclipse,6.5,3.7,15,8,"* And the little blue light that comes on when you turn the highbeams on is way too bright and is annoying to the driver... no way to dim that light with the dash controls.500 miles so far, like looks, handling, fosgate sound, tires, int looks, DISLIKE noisy engine and interior like there's no sound dampening, maybe that's why they offer the 650 watt stereo!
* In the end you get a little more than what you pay before.I have owned my Eclipse gs for about four months now with about 4,000 miles on it and found it to be fun to drive, good acceleration and a great sound system but I am noticing that in wet weather the car loses traction around curves and slides and wonder what it will be like in winter driving with snow and ice other than that the car is pretty nice.I love Eclipses!
* Insurance is very reasonable, gas mileage is great (30 mpg), and I don't see many on the road so I get lots of looks!I am very happy with my purchase, car has been flawless so far.
* The way it looks, the way it feels when you drive it, the 650 Watts sound system is great.
"
265,2008,buick,enclave,5.8,3.5,121,86,"* Like the manual shifter in the mountains.We looked at the Acadia, Outlook, SRX and Mazda cx9 and ended up with the enclave...much nicer (classier) interior than all but the SRX, and it has a 4 year warranty too...took a 1200 mile trip on day 4 and the car ran perfectly...very smooth and quiet ride, in fact one of the most quiet cars I?ve driven...the front seats are very comfortable and I didn't get out of the car after 3 or 4 hours all tired and stiff...no complaints so farNow driven for about 1000 miles and am absolutely impressed.
* Buick is on track with one of the finest SUv's ever built by GM's so called ""Mom and Dad's"" Buick vehicle line.
* Love how quiet the ride is, the DVD system is great for the kids, great heat, tons of room, very safe on ice or in poor winter driving conditions, visibility good in front and lights are perfect for highway driving.
* The steerable headlights are great at night...and, unlike the Mazda, you aren't forced to choose between a rear seat DVD and a sunroof...the Buick has two roofs...Congrats GM on finally getting it right!Former Audi ownerSo after much consideration between all the lambda options, we kept coming back to the Buick Enclave CXL.
"
266,2008,saturn,aura,5.9,3.5,58,41,"* I have owned 2005 VUE for the past 2 years and it seem to be cheaply made, the Aura so far from I can tell is a well built car and worth the $21K, I looked at other cars with the same options that were in the $30K range and not as nice to drive, Saturn has a winner with the Aura.
* The Aura handle nicely and is very comfortable, seems to have a lot of power with good gas mileage, Very quite car when on the highway doing 80 mph, and big bang for the buck.We had a 2008 Saturn Vue and had problems so I took it back before the 30 day return was up and got an Aura.
* The Saturn team really nailed this one and I hope to see the Aura aroudn for a long time!I was lookinng at both the Saturn and the new Chevy Malibu.
* When I sit in the Aura it makes me feel like I'm surrounded in luxury and its so quiet, Saturn uses Acoustic Laminated Glass to reduce wind and road noise contributing to a very quiet ride.
"
267,2008,infiniti,m45,6.4,3.6,7,4,"* Overall 9/10, only because I know, there is better cars out there which I have not tried yet.After thoroughly reviewing several cars from BMW (3 and 5 series), Jaguar (XF), Mercedes (C class), Lexus (IS F), I settled upon the M45 sport, almost fully loaded (lacks mobile DVD system).
* Bad features are gas mileage and noise level.The 2008 M45x is one of the most luxurious and best handling sedans in this category.
* ), the M45 simply glimmers best in everything overall, and at a respectable price comparatively.I have the Sport model.
* It may not be the best in every category but the combination of luxury, performance and features is excellent.When I was shopping for a new car, I checked out several in the price range of 50000-60000.
"
268,2008,kia,rondo,6.9,3.7,22,10,"* Couldn't be happier space inside is great for having car seats, plenty of storage in the back ( I have the 5 seater) Very comfortable to ride, good pick up on the pedal.
* Lots of special features like air vents in the back seat, plenty of cupholders, storage-did I mention the back seats recline a little (which is great for long trips).
* The vehicle gets good gas mileage, handles well and has decent power with the V6, and the price was right for us.We have the car exactly 1 year, almost 17000 miles.
* To be honest I was ready to purchase a Mazda5 but decided to stop in at Kia one day and got a deal that is hard to beat and purchased the vehicle for a good amount less than I could get the Mazda.
"
269,2008,bmw,5_series,4.4,3.4,56,71,"* I recommend the sport package in any BMW you purchase, after all, BMW is the Ultimate Driving Machine, so how you can not get the sport package.
* I traded in a Honda S2000 and it was fun to drive, but this BMW is almost as much fun to drive and it is much more comfortable.
* Bravo BMW!This is the third BMW 5 series I've owned, and they've all been great cars.
* Coming from Acura TL, never thought I'd say ""Good value"" about a BMW, but the performance, ride, sound and handling are so amazingly solid while seating 4, it's difficult to imagine why you'd spend so much more for a little impractical Porsche (compare 0-60), or unpredictable Maserati GT.
"
270,2008,mazda,mazdaspeed_mazda3,5.0,3.7,20,20,"* I will probably keep this car forever as nothing even remotely close to its price is appreciably faster and nothing this fun to drive has as much utility.If you haven't heard, the Mazdaspeed 3 is one of the best bangs for the buck.
* The car is just all around fun to drive, and with the hatch and the fact that it makes its power from the turbo charger, it's practical too!
* You can go 80 in third if you want, you can take curves at 60 with no sway at all, or you can drive it sedately and still get a fun drive and pretty decent gas mileage.
* The name said it all ""Speed"", it's fast, great handling, sexy body, this car got everything you need in a performance car.
"
271,2008,mazda,cx-9,6.3,3.7,82,49,"* I picked up a new top of the line 2008 Mazda CX9 Grand Touring for my wife in January of 2009.This car is amazing comparing to other SUV?s like the Ford Edge, Nissan Murano and the Lincoln MKX the CX-9 was the best choice for the money.The CX-9 is Sporty, stylish and roomy loads of cargo space, easy access to spacious third row, even for an average-sized adult, The two- passenger third-row seat is one of the roomiest you'll find.
* I give it 7 stars.After test driving the '08 Honda Pilot, '09 Honda Pilot, '08 Toyota Highlander, '08 Ford Edge, and the '08 Mazda CX-9 twice on two different occasions, it was clear to us the CX-9 was a great fit for our family.
* There are so many things right with the vehicle it's shorter to point out the bad: poor gas mileage I'm getting 14.5 mixed even w/tires running extra pressure (that must be why there isn't a trip computer), no adjustment for passenger seat tilt (things slide forward off the seat), no trip computer (already covered), if you pay $400 to get the satellite radio option - not only do you pay $400 but lose aux/iPod jack (double whammy), voice recognition feature associated with bluetooth stinks (and no, I have all my teeth) rain sensing wipers don't sense all that well.I've been a devoted MDX guy and thought I'd try something different.
* This is the first vehicle I don't have to put the seat ALL the way back!I considered Audi Q7, Acura MDX, 2008 Toyota Highlander, GMC Acadia, etc., but no one can come close to this vehicle in terms of performance, quality and price.
"
272,2008,suzuki,sx4,6.0,3.5,47,31,"* While the little three bangers were great on gas, and very dependable, they weren't nearly as well built and fun to drive as my SX4 Sport.
* It had to be my brand new SX4 but you wouldn't even notice the dealership did an excelent job, another great thing about SX4Overall this is a fun to drive little car.
* Suggested Improvements - This is all based on the SX4 Sport Sedan - Sunroof option, remote start, leather seating with heated seats, auto up & down windows on all four windows, auto locking doors at 15 mph & auto unlocking doors when shifted into park, auto on/off headlights, smaller keyless remote that doesn't take up some much room in your pocket, longer wheel base to improve looks & give more rear seat leg room, better gas mileage with better acceleration, larger fuel tank for longer driving We bought this car for safety, air bag protection, and traction in snow and ice in Wyoming.
* It gets pretty good gas millage for have allwheel drive I get 28.1 though 29.0 mpg most of the time but not in winter winter I see about 20-24 mpg I live in Indiana so I see alot of snow.
"
273,2008,pontiac,solstice,4.8,3.5,15,16,"* I love all the attention the women give me just for a ride.I drive a lake road to and from work every day, it's like a road course, this car is the most fun you can have with your clothes on.What a fun car to drive!
* It looks great and is a lot of fun to drive!My father told me to buy an S2000 and my brother said Miata, so I bought my Solstice.
* yes, the interior design team must have had a party the night before, but the fun factor outweighs the negatives.With cat-like agility and blistering acceleration, I just love my solstice gxp.
* It would be great if the top were powered instead of manual but it's not difficult to put up & down.
"
274,2008,hyundai,veracruz,7.1,3.6,55,22,"* !I just recently bought the Veracruz and last week just to break it in my wife and I drove to Tampa from N.Y to start off the fuel economy was better than expected it cost about 75.00 each way that was driving at or about 70-80 mph the comfort was great although would have liked just a little more leg room I'm 6-3 but by far more room than the lexus.I bought the base gls fwd model a left over 2008 It has excellent road handling perfect interior and 7 passenger seating and has alot of bells and whistles for the base model lots of storage space as well as oooohh and the price about 20,000 less than the lexus which I looked at first but to be honest this drives better Purchased Veracruz LTD AWD in February 2009.
* !Ater I purchased this car, I drive this car every night after my wife and son go to bed ~ :) I can not hear any noise from out side ~ it is like my computer room with playing Sara Brightman / Andrea Bocheli ""Time to say goodbye"" ~ Just AWSOME!I looked at them all but the Veracruz was clearly the best for me.
* It is our first Hyundai and I wouldn't go back and buy a different vehicle if I could!This is my first Hyundai and I'm very happy with the vehicle so far.
* To all who dont look at Veracruz before you buy, shame on you for the money and all you get this is the best buy on the market as Paul Harvey would say good day!We love this car.
"
275,2008,honda,fit,5.7,3.5,93,69,"* Fit, finish, and ergonomics are all top notch at a lower cost than most hybrids.Well first off I gave the 2008 Honda fit sport auto trans 10 rating on every thing I really really like this car I had driven this car in Brazil in 2004 way before they came here and just fell head or heals for the car but I drive this car to work at 5.00am no traffic all highway 15 miles one way so we will say 80-85 % highway and that is low the first 700 miles I got 17 mpg from 700 to 1600 got 24 mpg drove from Champaign il to Cincinnati last week end all highway no stopping 70 miles per got 27 mpg then Champaign to ind 2 days ago got 28 mpg so if it was summer and I had the ac on and driving in a city I can't see more then 17 or 18 mpg so I will be trading this in soon for a Toyota This is one very Nice car!.
* I am hoping I just don't have the 1 Sport AT FIT that likes to eat gas as much as it does people and cargo.I have had my little fit for about three weeks now and am lovin it, it is a great little car for a small family, the comfort is very good as I am 6' 2"" and I fit quite comfortably, the power from the 1.5L VTEC is quite adiquite, and the maual shift is silky smooth, I would have liked to have seen more durable carpeting but the quailty is still superb (remember this is a Honda), the first time I filled up I calculated right at 37 MPG 50/50 city/hwy driving which im very happy about.
* Great interior, fun to drive, great on gas and I believe it is called a ""Fit"" because you can fit everything in is it feels so roomy on the inside.
* I just wish I hadn't totaled it.Excellent, good handling good audio, easy to drive, excellent on gas, very roomy, fun to drive.I got one of the first Fit's available in '06 when they were introduced (05/06) and I have put 40,000 happy commuter miles on it so far.
"
276,2008,nissan,quest,6.2,3.6,16,10,"* Doesn't feel like driving a mini-van at all.I have only owned it for a month but I can say it has great power for a minivan.
* I love this van & would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone in the market for a new mini-van w/ a large family.This is our 1st mini-van and we had our eyes set on Odyssey and Sienna.
* With the Quest, not only does it not look like your average mini-van, but you feel like you're driving a luxurious car, not some soccer mom vehicle (even though that's what it is).
* I would recommend this van to anyone, and for what you get for the price compared to odyssey and sienna its a great deal.
"
277,2008,hyundai,elantra,7.0,3.6,109,47,"* She gets great gas mileage, good on the roads, and just overall a very comfortable car.I looked around at other cars such as the Toyota Corolla and the Honda Civic, but the Hyundai Elantra stood out to me because of it's low price and vast amount of standard features.
* Excellent value in a car unless you are over six feet tall.Checked on-line for gas mileage and reliabilty and of course I had my choices from Hyundai's, Honda's, Kia's, Toyota's, and Saturns.
* You will not be disapointed!After owning a 2007 Elantra GLS for the past year (actually my husband's car), I decided when my minivan lease came due this month I would buy another Hyundai Elantra GLS...Well, I did and I'm so glad.
* What a great car for a great price!The Elantra is a nice car with a great interior and decent performance.
"
278,2008,nissan,altima,5.8,3.6,127,93,"* Great gas mileage, great car.I love the new '08 Altima, I shopped around between an accord, camry, malibu, and even a 3 series and still loved the altima more!
* Honestly, with 4 liters, I get the power I need and my parents do not have to worry like a V6.Great shape, fun and active drive with power to match, comfortable and cool interior, really cool car to make a statement for young executives with a zest for life.Test drove Honda Civic, Honda Accord and Nissan Altima.
* But on the more positive side the car is really a nice car, nice styling and the engine is a little noisy but runs good it is too bad that it's suspension is not adequate to give a more comfortable ride overall.Before I saw the 2008 Altima, my mind was set on a Camry, but after seeing and reading about the Altima, my mind changed.
* I really like my car a lot however I don't know if I am too thrilled that I am having brake problems already.The window sticker says 23-33 mpg, the mpg gauge on the dash says 32 mpg highway and 23 mpg city, but in actuality it only gets 21 mpg city and 26 mpg highway.
"
279,2008,gmc,acadia,5.8,3.6,97,70,"* Buttons,too many and too small.Back up sensors,rapid beeping when your 1"" away,you might as well hit the object.Sensor lights,too high in rear of truck,you have to bend down to see them,then you can't see out rear view mirror.Windshield wipers,a dial,stupid,should be arm,as on foreign cars,easier to use at night.Controls on steering wheel,too close to wheel hand grips,radio changes when you don't want it too.Worst feature,transmission doesn't downshift quick enough at high speeds.You step on the gas,NOTHING,poor and slow to no response.Worse with AC on.Overall,too many features not though out.I have always been a Ford Girl and have driven an Expedition for the last 10 years.
* Really like this SUV, looks good, handles well, gas mileage not bad at around 22 on road, very smooth ride.
* While the gas mileage isn't great, we get lots of enjoyment from the bose speakers, ipod jack, heated seats, dvd player, two sun roofs, OnStar navigation, hands-free calling through my Verizon service, remote start that automatically adjusts the interior temperature, and the best cup holders ever made.
* Looks aren't everything and if GMC can't do better than to make a vehicle with such poor gas mileage, they should stop making them.
"
280,2008,chevrolet,colorado,5.7,3.6,21,16,"* There is nothing not to love about this truck!I have the 5 cylinder3.7 litre engine (242 horsepower) It has plenty of power, awesome gas mileage for a truck.
* Only complaints I have are the keyless entry doesn't work aall the time the first time and the engine fan is incredibly loud when it's engaged.I opted for the Colorado because of the MPG and for the tow rating.
* Gas mileage is better than indicated by 2-3 mpg.I bought my 2008 truck new Dec 27, 2007 (it only have 2400 miles on it now ) and it has spent more time in the shop than on the road.
* Gas mileage is not as good as I was lead to belief for a 5 cyl it should be a lot better.
"
281,2008,volkswagen,eos,5.5,3.6,27,22,"* It's so fun to drive I put 5000 miles on it the first month fast to watch out v-8s Fun to drive, lots of standard features because with VR6, a lot of things are standard.
* If you're looking for fun with enough room for some friends or a golf bag in the back seat, the Eos is the best choice out there.I have only had my new '08 VW Eos for 3 weeks now but it has been a blast!!
* I love the way people get so excited when they see it go from hard top to convertible.
* I'm working with my dealer to get it squared away because the hard top convertible is the main reason I bought this car.
"
282,2008,infiniti,m35,4.6,3.6,16,19,"* A6/A8 are too confusing, GS/LS are too boring, XF is as good if not better, but less room in the back.I traded in my 2006 M35 for a 2008 M35s after 34 months because I was very happy with the first M35 and after looking at other cars in its class believe that the current Infiniti pricing and financing deals make the choice for me.It's the perfect car for me.
* Good all-around handling for the money led me to choosing the M35 over BMW, Acura, Lexus and Mercedes (I tested them all).I looked at BMW, Audi, Lexus, and Mercedes in addition to Infiniti.
* I only had the car for 3 months, but it was a great car and I loved it and will probably buy another one when I'm able to drive again.Had an 06 M35 Sport, got this M35x when lease expired.
* Very nice ride and a lot of fun to drive, quiet at highway speeds but it could have a little better mileage.
"
283,2008,dodge,magnum,4.2,3.4,5,7,"* The my gig system works well  great sound.I thought I would not like the base Magnum SE with the 2.7L engine, I was wrong.
* Also considered Cadillac DTS and Buick Lucerne, Magnum has a better quieter ride and is roomier.I love my Magnum.
* I recently completed a 4000 mi roadtrip and it was great.... very comfortable (I'm 6'4""), and it didn't even downshift going up mountain passes.
* Good but not great fuel economy but it's a big V-8 so one does not buy this car for the mileage.
"
284,2008,jeep,grand_cherokee,5.6,3.6,40,32,"* The interior of this car is more beautiful than anything I have seen or driven, including the various Acura's, BMW's, and MB's I've had and my friend's Cayenne.
* Leather, fog lites, sunroof, all power, heated seats, adjustable pedals, etc ... First tank at just over 18 mpg and though it's not a strong engine, it's good enough for what I need.
* Overall we have been very pleased with the vehicle Having leased over 4 Jeep Grand Cherokee's in the past 9 years, I find driving this vehicle extremely exhilerating besides, I have only had it for a week.
* i wish it had more oomph at 40 mph but this jeep engine is for better fuel economy.I've Owned and driven many types of SUV's, from the Ford Expedition, and Explorer, Suburban, Dodge Durango, which I've all owned.
"
285,2008,jeep,liberty,6.0,3.6,59,39,"* It has great Jeep looks, the Ride is car like, and feels roomy inside.I bought this car with the intention of making small modifications to improve the offroad work, like wheels and lights, only to find out later that the modifications shown in the catalog will not be produced by Jeep Chrysler, and the dealership gave me the heave-ho when I went back after discovering this false advertisingI had a Suburban that had close to 200k.
* Have not really checked the mileage yet, nor do I know how reliable the vehicle the will be, but I have owned 4x4's from Wranglers to Chevy and Dodge trucks and this one is just as good for on road snow driving!Having had the 2004 Liberty and hating it since 2 days after delivery, I was a bit skeptical about the 2008 model.
* Dealer has had vehicle back 3 times and can't duplicate the problem so now vehicle sits in my driveway because no repairs have been made and I feel it's not safe to drive.
* I went with the Liberty Limited, since it had so many standard safety features, and slightly better gas mileage then the new Wranglers, plus the incentives were better for the Liberty.I traded a 2002 Ford Explorer full size with 102,000 miles, wanted a smaller vehicle with the features of the big suv.
"
286,2008,nissan,titan,6.4,3.6,44,25,"* Anyway, I love my Titan, its a sexy beast.Had a 2007 chevy LTZ-got a GMC-SLT-2009 Ford FX4-This Titan blows away what we're making in Detroit.The power is there always-the sound ststem is better than you can get at home-It is by far the best truck that I have ever owned.The Titan LE is the best choice by far.I have been a GM man for 35 years and decided to try the new 2009 F150 and the new seats killed my back.The Titan has the extra power- smoothe ride and nice seats that the Sierra offers.I have a truck now that I plan on putting many more miles on it.I took this truck out on the road and it was something else lots of room and get up and go.
* '08 Titan, AC drain leaks onto passenger side carpet, rear vibration, guages reflect in side mirror at night, 15MPG, gas spills down the side of truck if you fill up too quickly when low on gas - Udated info available in forums under nissan titan repair and maintenanceI went looking for a replacement for my 2002 Ford F150 Supercrew.
* PRO4x ride is firmer than LE but smooth on highway.I have driven my 08 Titan 2500 miles so far and this is a great truck.
* I wonder where the Tundra would be if Toyota gave up after just one shot at it?Love all the extra interior room.Traded in an extended cab Z71 for crew cab Titan.
"
287,2008,ford,escape_hybrid,5.6,3.7,46,36,"* Gas mileage has been better than advertised, averaging over 34 miles per gallon composite city and highway driving (I do drive with economy in mind and have filled my tires with dry nitrogen which also helps economy).
* I am getting about 25 miles to the gallon but if you like to stay cool during the summer months forget driving in electric mode - the one thing they don't tell you is you won't go electic with the AC on even in econ mode!The Escape Hybrid has surpassed my '71 Firebird as the coolest car I've ever owned.
* The gas mileage is good, not great but good and it is a little quieter inside on the highway than my old one.
* The hybrid system is awesome - having fun trying to see how many MPG's I can acheive!I bought my Escape Hybrid because I commute 70 miles each way to work over mountains so I needed good MPG and reliability in bad weather conditions.
"
288,2008,mercedes-benz,r-class,6.8,3.6,30,14,"* We're no longer getting an S-class since the R- class also carries a lot of panache and grandeur without being too overbearing especially when we self- drive on the weekend and during vacation and not use the drivePro?s: I had an BMW X3 and drove the X5 along with the MDX the MB had the smoothest ride, best safety features (BMW doesn?t have third row curtin airbags), 3 rows of seating and the greatest comfort in the third row.

"
289,2008,audi,a5,6.7,3.6,16,8,"* The dealer had an A5 with an Audi factory installed S5 option (cosmetic kit) so I have S-Line interior trim, upgraded 19"" wheels (that I like better than the ""S"") and claimed mileage up to 32 MPG (we'll see - I do a lot of highway driving).I've owned more than 18 cars over the past 23 years (mostly premium imports -- Audi, BMW, MB, Lexus, Acura), and the A5 is one of my favorites.
* I was surprised that certain people had no idea that Audi was launching an A5 model until they saw mine on the road.My first Audi and so far is excellent.
* I have had no mechanical problems except a burned-out LED light that was replaced and have noticed no rattles in the car after 12,000 miles.The Audi A5 is a terrific diver's car.
* I cannot say enough about the A5's drive.
"
290,2008,audi,q7,6.1,3.6,11,7,"* The MMI system works great (much better than the iDrive in my wife's BMW 3 series) and the advanced parking system makes short work of tight parking spaces.This is my first return to a German car in 6 years.
* The Q7 S-line is a cool looking SUV, if the cool design does not turn heads, the screeching brakes will!I've had this vehicle now for about 9 months and completely love it.
* Love the S-Line option but Audi takes 2 points off the residual value for leases which doesn't seem fair when you pay more.I have had my Q7 4.2 premium s line for about 3 weeks.
* Great car for a great trip.I love the car but am so disappointed that with a Britax diplomat infant rear-facing seat (one of the smallet, most narrow on the market) installed in the center position (the safest), I can only use one of the two adjacent seats.
"
291,2008,toyota,fj_cruiser,5.6,3.6,29,23,"* So, either buy it for city driving or buy a different vehicle for off-road use if you need a warranty.The FJ has great power, excellent off road capability, and handles like a dream.
* The ride is unbelievably smooth and powerful with the 4.0 L 6cylinder engine.No carpet/easy clean interior!I love this truck, it's fun to drive, has great performance, kickin' stereo and looks real cool.I just got it and I'm in love!
* The only problem is getting into the back seat - Toyota should have provided some kind of handle to help pull yourself into the back seating area (my youngest struggles to get back there, clawing at anything she can to help herself in).This is a fun to drive, off road 4X4.
* It drives great, handles great for the vehicle type, and it has very good power to get up & go.
"
292,2008,subaru,tribeca,5.7,3.7,32,24,"* The ride is very smooth and quiet.Great all around vehicle  it does OK on gas  it looks and drives fantastic... best large vehicle I've ever owned.This is my first Subaru and I am very happy with it.
* We were looking at the Honda Pilot(booring look), Toyota Higlander Hybrid(cheapo interior, drives like truck), GMC Acadia(drives like a bigger gas guzzling truck),Acura MDX (liked this but not as much as the Subaru for lots of little reasons not to mention value).
* We are just starting to look for my wife a new car and the 2009 Forester is looking like the front runner.Leased this vehicle in April 2008.Love the comfortable smooth ride.
* reminds me of bad ball joints in an old car  acceleration at cruising speed not smooth, instead feels out of balance  gas cap rests on exterior paint during refuel, need telescoping steering wheel  back seats wobble and make noise as does the rear seat belt from the ceiling  exhaust makes tinny vibration sound when accelerating hard.
"
293,2008,suzuki,grand_vitara,6.5,3.5,11,6,"* All my friends want one & the VP of my company said he was definitely going to look into Suzuki SUV's when they purchase their next car.
* Went with the Suzuki and thus far no regrets.I purchased the GV for my wife due to the ever rising gas prices and let me be the first to say ""We are impressed!""
* If gas mileage is a primary concern a Rav4, Vue or CR-V would be a better choice.So far this little truck has been doing a great job for my wife and I.
* I wasn't looking at Suzuki at first to replace our 2004 Honda CRV which was totaled after a accident but after owning and driving the Vitara I am quite impressed with its performance and styling, inside and out.
"
294,2008,hyundai,accent,6.4,3.6,44,25,"* I bought this car for commuting in the NYC area I own a 07 silverado its a Nice truck but too much fuel this 08 accent took care of that its a pleasure to drive love the radio XM the air its always ice cold 6 airbags love the warranty had to pay extra for my gm one its a Nice car for the price got mine for 13,500 had pinstripe on it front rear mats cargo net and rear cargo mat thanks Hyundai keep up the good work got 600 miles on it no problems.
* With the Accent, I get good gas mileage, reliability, freezing cold A/C even on the hottest Texas days, good looking body style (girls tell me it's ""cute""), solid feel, excellent warranty, crazy tight turning radius, XM radio (LOVE the XM!
* Not acceptable.Honestly, I was set on buying either a Nissan Versa or Sentra but now I see that my Hyundai Accent was a great choice and is a great starter car for me because of the great gas mileage it gets and it is compact with all the necessary options.
* I retract my first review.I picked up my 08 Accent about a week ago, I did about 4 weeks of research before choosing the little Hyundai, The car is fun to drive, looks good and best of all gets 27mpg city and 35 highway.
"
295,2008,gmc,yukon_hybrid,5.7,3.6,8,6,"* A great job by GM!After having owned the Yukon Hybrid for about a week, I have found the Yukon fun and easy to drive with excellent gas economy.
* Very Happy with the truck, getting better gas milage than my BMW x3 with a weak six cylinder.This is an amazing truck that has all of the ""eco-modifcations"" commonly discussed for trucks: aerodynamic styling, light weight engine / body parts, hybrid drive train.
* We recently bought our Yukon Hybrid as a demo model, so got a great deal (GM Certified used vehicle - 41,000 miles left on bumper-to-bumper warranty).
* The sticker on the vehicle said EPA Estimate of 20 City/20 Hwy (However, the fine print says ""16-24 depending upon driving conditions"" (paraphrasing), which give GM a great deal of flexibility, while disappointing the buyer!
"
296,2008,pontiac,g5,3.0,3.5,7,16,"* Bought it to save on gas, but I am still kicking myself today for trading in my 2006 GTO for this joke of a vehicle!I bought my G-5 last July as sort of an impulse buy, part of the ""new me"" I wish I would have done more research on this vehicle.
* i got rid of my 05 Pontiac G6 because it was falling apart at only 40,000 miles also i need a commuter car that would get better gas mileage.
* Gas mileage stinks, I'm lucky to get 24 miles to the gallon, maybe, if I drove 55 on the California freeways, I think not.This car is good for someone buying their first new vehicle.
* Bigger guys definitely should not purchase this car because I guarantee you that you will not be comfortable!My job involves driving over an extensive area, and the mileage I get with my G5 is worth every penny that I spend on gas (30-32 mpg highway, 25-29 mpg city).

297,2008,smart,fortwo,5.3,3.4,80,72,"* It's fun to drive and bring smiles where ever I go, can park it in many places nobody else can, I'm averaging 40 mile to gallon but as high as 45 when I drive slower--I've had no problem with it on x-way and driven it as fast as 85 hour without any problems passing trucks or being passed, I'm big guy 6,2 250 and quite comfortable in it even wearing my cowboy hat most of the time to--if I had to do it all over I'd still buy it-- it even saved me on my insurance, it's not for everyone but it sure fit my needs make great runabout, I'm very pleased with it over allI drove the Smart for 14 miles each way to and from work for 6 months, enjoying the good mileage and fun handling.
* The gas mileage is OK, 33-38 mpg with mostly in town driving, but it is so much fun to drive and pass the big land yachts that are so prevalent in Naples Florida.I received my Smart Cabriolet after a 12 mo.
* It is fun to drive and it looks sporty.The smart is definitely fun to drive, and has excellent mileage.
* It is fun to drive and while it doesn't ride like a Mercedes Benz, I didn't pay for a Mercedes Benz.I love driving my Lil Tic Tac.
"
298,2008,dodge,dakota,8.6,3.4,12,2,"* The Toyota rides a little better, but the Dakota, even with the V-6 Auto has better passing ability.
* It's red, fast, looks sporty, handles great, rides good, doors open wide, seats firm and supportive, tows, looks good anywhere, best warranty of anyone.
* Ride is pretty good for a pickup truck.After having a Honda, and a Toyota, I find my new Dakota to be their equal in terms of build quality.
* In fact I drove a Ridgeline, and a Tacoma on the same day I drove the Dakota, and the Dakota blew them away in terms of quietness and ride quality.
"
299,2008,infiniti,g35,5.8,3.6,76,55,"* The G35 delivers luxury and performance that Lexus and Acura cannot match.I got the 2008 G35 Journey with the tire and wheel package, premium package and navigation package.
* I love driving it and it has so many great tech items on the car.I honestly wanted to purchase a BMW 325i  however, in the end I ended up with an Infiniti G35.
* Have to drive one to truly apperciate how great this car is.The G35S 6MT is one of the finest luxury sedans in its class, and, with attractive pricing comparable to the BMW 328, it certainly is closing the gaps in quality, performance and affordability.
* Just came down from an M35X to a G35X Sport and I love this car it has almost everything I want in a car and it handles like a dream, the feel of this car is very solid and the finish is excellent, the power is great and I don't hear any wind nose like others have said.
"
300,2008,hyundai,santa_fe,5.5,3.6,71,57,"* Totally satisfied 2nd Hyundai owner!This is the best suv I have ever owned, coming out of a lease of a denali which sucked gas I have never been so happy, it first started when my mother purchased a 2008 sonata limited and I thought Hyundai mom why did you purchase a sonata and she replied it drove better then the competition and I have to say it does down to the options Hyundai offers, well I am spoiled and I have to have every option so I purchased a 2008 Santa Fe limited with navigation and bluetooth and every option you can get including every accessory down to the wheel locks, mud guards tubes and the cross rails front bra and cargo tray etc, I love this vehicle so much I would definately repurchase again way to go!I purchased this vehicle and have had it a month.
* However, if you do a daily commute in heavy traffic you might not appreciate the best parts of this car (it's quiet ride, 5-speed automatic, comfortably supportive seats), and you will definitely get worse mpg!I bought this suv because it road so smooth and quiet which makes the 605 Watt stereo sound even better.
* Overall, these are small issues.I've had the chance to drive both the new 2008 Honda CR-V and the 2008 Hyundai Santa-fe and personally I would for Santa-fe the ride isn't bad and handles NYC pot holes like a charm it's more roomier then the CR-V with more cargo space then CR-V.
* Anyone more than 6' tall will feel a bit scrunched by the vehicle roof when driving (my boyfriend is 6'2"" and feels the roof is uncomfortably close to his head).Overall, a good value for the money compared with other SUVs in this class.However...at 4000 km there was an oil leak which took 3 trips to the dealership and was finally fixes with silocone sealant.During the winter,the windshield washer fluid reservoir broke and had to be replaced.Windshield is surprisingly fragile - accidentally dropped the wiper arm when replacing the wipers and the windshield cracked all the way to the top.I also have a 2005 Chevy Malibu and the Santa Fe is missing a lot of the nice add-ons.It even doesn't have auto on headlights (come on, I get leather seats and not this!
"
301,2008,pontiac,vibe,7.0,3.5,16,7,"* This car is a great car to run around town with your kids or take a tripThis is now our second Vibe based on our great experience with our '05 Vibe.
* I do like driving it tho, not sure if we will keep car tho with gas mileage poor.I was attracted to this car for its potential for versatility and gas mileage.
* Getting 32-34 mpg using 10% ethanol.As you can see from our ratings, we are enjoying the comfort and gas mileage of our Vibe.
* I average 34 mpg on the highway with an automatic.I have just had this car for 3 weeks, but, I am a tall woman (5,10"") and this is the most comfortable car to drive, and still be fuel efficient.Bought for gas mileage, style, and storage capacity.
"
302,2008,mazda,tribute,4.2,3.7,16,22,"* I have a 6yr and a 1year old, even on long trips, it's a little small.. but good on gas (which is most important to us) I would buy from this Mazda again because my buying AND service experience has been great!!!
* I would recommend this car to anyone that wants a economical small SUV!I am very disappointed with this purchase, paint has been chipping and continues to bubble on pieces that had been repainted noise in front sounds like needing new breaks this was all in 3 months of purchasing.
* The Tribute has a ton of standard features and Mazda did a great job with instilling the ""sport"" into driving, even in this SUV.
* It's really growing on me.I just purchased this SUV after looking at, reading about and test driving almost every small SUV out here.This is one of the sharpest ones, inside and out, on the market.
"
303,2008,chevrolet,uplander,3.8,3.6,5,8,"* To start with..The interior design is the worst ever.The seats in the second row are very poorly designed,you cannot recline fully because the seats hit against the interior side walls,they are too narrow and uncomfortable and lack knee space,they should also have been made to swivel.The side sliding doors should have sliding windows on them,not fixed windows.The cruise control is totally in the wrong location, and when in use is not smooth at all.The cigarette lighter or auxiliary outlet is in a very dumb and dangerous location (almost on the floor)makes it nearly impossible to use.The rear door is dangerous when opening,it will slam you in the face if you are not careful.
* Trading it in while it's still under warranty so whoever gets it can get all the problems fixed under the bumper to bumper warranty.After reading all the horror stories about this vehicle and its brothers I bought one anyway because I love the body style and the ease of entry for passengers, and I was able to talk the dealer into $500 for an additional 4 year 48,000mi bumper to bumper warranty.
* Keep your fingers crossed for me.It was a rental van.It""s fully loaded and so nice to drive.I drive alot for work and bought it just as a work van to haul things or to take groups to different meetings.We loved our 9 year old Venture but had to replace it.
* Missing are the swing out electric powered windows at the far rear as well as a front seat storage drawer and other storage spaces the Venture had.
"
304,2008,chevrolet,malibu,5.3,3.6,101,90,"* (although I don't think thats necessarily a bad thing) The car itself is beautiful and I am absolutly in love with the interior, especially the ""ambient blue lighting"" The gas mileage does leave me wanting more, but I am biased, my last car was a 99 Sunfire which got great mileage, but wasn't nearly as much car as this one is, so I guess it's an even trade.
* Hint: Premium perks it up if you're in the mood.When car reached around ten thousand miles it developed a problem with the transmission.When you try to maintain speed from forty miles per hour or higher the torque converter feels like it is engaging and disengaging from drive to overdrive continuously.The tach jumps about three or four hundred rpm up and down.You take your foot off the gas pedal for a second and then resume maintaning your speed and the problem goes away for a few miles if your lucky.The service manager at the dealership we bought the car from says this is normal.I don't know how anybody can say that is normal.Don't get me wrong my wife and I like the car except for the transmission issue.I have really hesitated in buying a Chevrolet again.
* Although the Accord is faste it's a v6, the interior of the Chevy isn't quite as nice as the accord but it's better than my previous Toyota Avalon We have been looking for a midsize car for some time now and thought we would wait after I saw the 08 Malibu.
* I think it's the tires - LTZ sportier but if an absolutely smooth quiet cruiser is what you want, I'd recommend the LT. Mileage isn't great but is what it said we'd get.
"
305,2008,gmc,yukon,5.9,3.6,13,9,"* I strongly recommend the GMC Denali if you like great performance (6.2L V-8 for towing),great interior features(heated seats,steering wheel,comfortable seating with lots of room) and nice look (new body style from the 2006 denali).
* If put into passing gear around 50, it appears a little anemic, so if I were to do it all over, I may opt for the 5.3 liter or get 3.73 rear end.I have owned 3 Chevy Tahoes, I decided to opt for the Yukon this time big difference between my last 2004 Chevy to the 2008 Yukon the ride is great my only drawback is the rear captian chairs it leaves no room for a full grown teenager let alone an adult.
* Other models like the 2008 Toyota Sequoia and 2008 Lincoln Navigator can sit full grown adults back there and does fold down to the ground and other crossovers of GM do this so why not the full size SUVs.We were putting to many miles on our 2005 Cayenne S and needed a second SUV.
* Far more power and even better ride than my previous SUV (Toyota Sequoia) and my 2007 H2.I have owned GM vehicles for 15 years now and this is by far the best I have ever had.
"
306,2008,cadillac,sts,3.8,3.4,9,15,"* High end imports are more reliable and give much better customer service.After 2 BMW,I just bought my first caddy at 36 yrs old.I was just tired seeing BMW,G35,NEW C-class even the new CTS every corner.
* Was looking at BMW, Mercedes Audi, Lexus and Infiniti for the money the STS was the best buy, 2008 STS Just delivered and drove from East Hampton Long Island to Myrtle Beach South Carolina.
* STS is right there and if the V8 G8 had AWD, I would be driving that.My first Caddy.
* I looked at evrything from BMW's, Acrua's other Cadillac's, and even the new Buick Enclave.
"
307,2008,chevrolet,tahoe_hybrid,2.9,3.6,4,10,"* On my gas Tahoe, I'd get 325 miles per tank if I was lucky, on the hybrid I can get 500 miles per fill-up.My hybrid stinks - Gas mileage is 16 MPG - Intermittent noise under hood that GM says cannot be fixed - been in shop over 45 days now.
* I'm always very proud to say it's more powerful than either of my 2 previous gas Tahoe's and I get 19-21 in town, and about the same on longer trips.
* I've had 2 other gas Tahoe's since 2004 and the #1 question I get when someone notices I have a Hybrid is ""does it have any power?
* We also got between 12.5 and 14.3 MPG, the truck would get 9.5 MPG.I've gotta say for the fuel efficiency, hands down, the best.
"
308,2008,bmw,x3,7.1,3.4,17,7,"* We have two kids and my wife can sit between the two car seats for our two our trip last weekend, and she's 5'8"", it is almost the same size as our 01 X5, but it is much quicker because it's 800 lbs lighter and it is also fuel efficientGot my 08 X3 two weeks ago, have all options except servotronic steering, sports performance package is a must, the 19"" wheels look so much better than the rest.
* Tried out RDX (nice at first glance, but plasticky inside), EX35 (great engine, but even shorter on utility than X3), even the new X5 (too big, hate iDrive), but this was the one I had to have.This has been a great car so far.
* The X3 drives great, it's a solid handler, great tracking, good road feel.
* It sticks to the road like glue, accelerates bullet like away from lights (or as bullet like as you'll get in an SUV) and it's very comfortable.
"
309,2008,jeep,patriot,5.7,3.6,90,67,"* It's very comfortable and has all the room we need, the mp3 stereo is a Nice touch and so is the great mileage.I bought this because it was affordable and would get good gas mileage.
* Love its looks in bad-boy black, I shoulda got the 17"" rims tho ...I was looking to upgrade to an suv,and was willing to trade off gas mileage, then came along the patriot.I'm not a serious off roader (let's face it,95% of you with suvs never see dirt), but I need to get to the trailhead or ski area, over moderately rocky and mucky logging roads with ease.I tested it this winter a few times up some steep mountain dirt roads in deep snow and an ice storm, no problem.
* The engine is still breaking in,getting 22 to 23 mpg mostly around town If you don't need a rock crawler or a super sized suv,and you'd rather put your hard earned money in the bank rather than your tank, this is your vehicle.With gas approaching $4/gallon, I applaud Jeep for thinking ahead.I just got my Dark Green Patriot.
* It's still too new for the engine to break in to get the best fuel mileage and to see it's true reliability down the road.
"
310,2008,chrysler,pacifica,4.0,3.3,8,12,"* I really like it!Well when I first went to the car lot I was looking for a Dodge or a Jeep because I thought a car like that wold be very hard to get to so when he told me that hey young men it is possible to get a crossover like that I was so happy he said that he so the light lite upon my face then I still said to myself that there no way in god's holy world that I could get a car with sleek body style and hard cover face and a banging grill with wood all over the place and with also comes with a tv and also comes with a navigation system and so much of room also to top it off it also comes with a sun roof I also like the way that the dashboard is made how goes aroundBlew out the Town & Country van for space, quality, comfort, and definitely the appearance.
* Sorry that Chrysler is not going to continue building them.Nice looking car, but it's only skin deep, interior is cheaply made, gas mileage is poor, lots of things missing that should be there like a glovebox light, ipod input, switches to shut of dome lights.
* Guess with the bumper to bumper lifetime warranty we'll drive it until it won't go.This is the second Chrysler Pacifica I've owned.
* Plenty of interior space and leg room for even the third row passengers.Got out of a lease on a 2005 Grand Cherokee (HEMI) and moved to more space, better MPG.
"
311,2008,chevrolet,aveo,5.2,3.6,31,29,"* Great car..minor issues covered by warranty.I was searching for a used car, well a man I know buys wrecked cars and fixes them up, I happened to see this lil 08 Aveo, and bought it on the spot, the front bumper is cracked but other than that it looks great, I drive alot because I am a grandma and the Aveo gets great mpg.
* If you're looking for a small car with good features and good gas mileage this is a good choice.
* If you want a car that gets graet mileage and you don't want to pay through the nose for it get an Aveo LT with the moon roof, you'll love it..This car was much better than I even expected!
* The gas mileage does not vary if my driving is on the highway or in town with a lot of starts and stops.I was disappointed in buying the 2008 Aveo.
"
312,2008,ford,edge,6.8,3.7,61,29,"* The dashboard gauges are hard to see in low lighting conditions.never saw him Got T- Boned @40+ making a left on to nortbound Smokey Pt Drive, New car, back probs, leaving PT ( Back ) 5 pm Poor vis, low heavy clouds & Lt rain, Waited for BIG open spot in traffic flow both ways, found one large one after some smaller gaps, decided to wait for a car 1/3 of way into left gap turn signal on, check both ways again still looks great, wait to see tire on car turn into my road, as they turn I gently pull out into center turn lane, 15 Ft away the 4X4's comming hard & BAM!
* My first new car in 12 years and glad I'm on the Edge!My husband and I test drove many crossover SUV's when we were searching for a new car and when we happened upon the Edge, it was love at first site.
* I could not be more pleased.Found car dead on sunday 2/03/08 called Ford for road side asst.they arrived little over an hour could not get car out of park.Tow driver told me there was nothing they could do for me and left.Called road side asst.
* I can't say enough good things about the SYNC system...LOVE ITWe have only had our New Edge 1 month,but so far we love this crossover from Ford.
"
313,2008,volvo,s80,5.0,3.8,11,11,"* The 281HP S80 T6 has plenty of oomph, and the handling, while not in the BMW's league, is a lot better than Volvo's previous sedans have been.
* Next time, I'll be sure to test drive a car on something other than the dealer's recommended route.This car is a great value for mid 30's range.
* The S80 T6 seemed to have what I was looking for: understated luxury, solid build, strong engine, comfortable ride, nice stereo and a reasonable price.
* This car has seats designed by chiropractors and orthopedic specialists and it beats all of the luxury cars out their for comfort, 3-level heated seats front and rear with power adjustments that make it perfect for any sized person.
"
314,2008,nissan,frontier,5.7,3.6,37,28,"* Would like to see Nissan incorporate their cvt technology into this 4 banger to maximize it's power.I traded my 2000 Nissan Frontier 2WD for a Silver 2008 Nissan Frontier 4WD & glad I did, I love the 4.0 V6 power.
* The Frontier is a great truck I would recommend that anyone in the market for a mid size truck take one on a test drive before they purchase another make.Checked out Frontier, Tacoma and Ranger.
* Comparing it to my brother's Tundra (which I drive some) I like the Frontier much better - Just fun to drive and thousands less than Toyota I wanted to trade my 2WD Ranger for a 4WD.
* Highway mileage isn't all that much better than the full sized Chevy 2 wheel drive, but city mileage is about 5 mpg better.
"
315,2008,subaru,legacy,6.6,3.7,59,31,"* I love it and recommend itI was hoping to get a nicer car but with gas prices exceeding $4 a gallon I didn't want to be getting 17 mpg so I leased this Subaru Legacy for 2 years at an excellent rate.
* I am so glad I bought this car.So far I've owned my Legacy for a little over a month and I have to say it's by far the best car I've ever owned.
* It handles great, and I just got 31 mpg on highway speed max at 65 mph to 60 mph for about 120 miles highway only.Coming from an unreliable 2006 Volvo S40, the Legacy is like a scaled-down version of God!
* It is effortless to drive and makes long distances feel like a breeze.Was reluctant to look at a Subaru until I disappointingly test drove Toyota's and Honda's in the same class.
"
316,2008,volvo,v70,7.3,3.8,8,3,"* I really like to drive it, and I typically drive a 350Z.I've had the car for two weeks, I am very satisfied with the vehicle, it's got lots of pep, is very stable in snow and ice, is rock solid on dry pavement, very tight steering, very little torque steer, great in tight turns at speed, a quiet and enjoyable ride.
* I was looking for a vehicle that would be capable of towing a small pop-up camper, yet not be as bulky as an SUV - a station wagon was a good solution, and the car is very comfortable.
* You will appreciate the comfort and convenience that the V70 provides, and although I have yet to see proof I hope that it is safe as well.Swapped for an E320 -- 1"" shorter and cavernous in the back, which I don't notice while I am having so much fun in these wonderful front seats, wheeling a surprisingly sporty but beautiful driver cabin.
* While I really enjoyed the super-quiet ride and precise handling of the Lexus, I am also enjoying the sportier driving experience of this Volvo.
"
317,2008,toyota,sienna,5.4,3.6,31,26,"* On a 2000 mile road trip we found the engine powerfully moves the van along and got nearly 26 mpg running mountainous roads and AC most of the way, even before the engine was fully broken in.With a growing family and need for the convenience and security of AWD/4WD we chose the Toyota Sienna.
* The van drives like a luxurious car, so roomy and comfortable that my toddler keeps asking to get on the van.
* It's just a week I started driving this but still few negative points like you can't make the 2nd row as bench seat by removing the middle seat and no power option for opening trunk in LE models.
* The van drives like a very nice full size car and handles well with great fuel economy.
"
318,2008,saturn,astra,6.1,3.5,68,43,"* really impressed with the Astra's looks.I love my new Astra 3dr XR.
* I considered buying a Mazda 3 as well but I felt the Astra's interior beat it while being just as fun to drive.
* Listen to the consumer and build the Astra!Great handling, great mpg (30-32 in everyday driving).
* I opted for the automatic - which is well matched to the engine but like all GM's it really, really should be 5 or even 6 speed like many competitors.
"
319,2008,toyota,camry_solara,6.4,3.6,23,13,"* Toyota built one outstanding car.I wanted a convertible so badly and picked this one (my first Toyota).
* Love the car with the top down, but hate it with the top up because of the rattles in the back side windows, especially the passenger side).
* Other that that I love this car, smooth ride and with the top down it is the most fun car I have ever owned.
* I will never be without a Toyota product!We shopped around for a coupe, and found that the Solara was the best car at the best price.Had a 2004 Solara and traded it in on a 2007 Camry SE 4 door in January of 2007.
"
320,2008,gmc,sierra_1500,6.3,3.6,46,27,"* Very comfortable.After driving my 1993 GMC extended cab for 15 years I decided to go shopping I found a deep crimson metallic gmc crew cab 4 wheel drive I kept going back and looking for about 3 months then I took it for a test drive and I had to have it I think this is a beautiful tough truck I can dress like a lady and go out on the town or I can get nasty dirty and and load it up with what ever and it never fails me I love the security of onstar and the enjoyment of xm radio.I get alot of compliments on how pretty my truck is my friends at work have named her Miss Pretty Immediately drove 2 WD truck (17"" tires) to central OH from central FL - 20.2 mpg @ cruise set mostly 75 mph.
* I have always loved GMC'S so I love this one too, it looks great and other than the squeak has been great.
* Owned since Valentines day, 7,000 miles later, several trips to Memphis, one to Tupelo, I can't even complain about the gas mileage (great for a truck), flex fuel management is great.
* Do yourself a favor and test drive a Denali when looking for a new truck!A family member bought the Tundra in Oct.'07-Toyota is making a big deal out of their 5.7L engine etc...the Tundra is a nice truck--but I decided to go with the Sierra for several reasons: Better road manners--especially on the freeway--very tight steering.
"
321,2008,lexus,es_350,4.6,3.5,24,28,"* After buying this I would recommend this car to anyone who is thinking about buying one.I love my 2008 Lexus ES 350, so quiet, comfortable, smooth, and saving a lot on gas - highly recommend this one for a luxury car.I replaced a Mercedes E320 for the Lexus ES350.
* Smooth, quiet and great ride.I was concerned about spending the extra money to get the Lexus ES 350.
* I absolutely love my new 08 and the Lexus service is unmatched from any other car manufacturer I've ever dealt with.I only had a couple of complaints with the 06 but as of now I have no complaints whatsoever with this baby.This is one fine automobile and to quote my ex, it's ride is as smooth as butter.
* I highly recommend this one!Traded in an 2006 Acura TL for the 2008 Lexus ES 350.
"
322,2008,chrysler,town_and_country,3.8,3.3,51,82,"* I hate this van!Save your money!We traded in a 2005 300 Limited and we thought it was going to be hard to find a car that would drive, ride, and have the things we wanted to enjoy trips in but the new 2008 Chrysler T&C Limited we think is by far the best car we have ever owned.
* A/C stopped working, can't get key out half the time,several dead batteries, brakes are sqeaking,rides like crap,14 MPG in town,rubber peice on rear bumper warped have to push it down to open rear door.Would loose $5000 if traded in.Never/ever buy a Chrysler/Dodge product.......First noticed the A/C doesn't work, then the headlights turned off at night while driving, and now we are loosing power to the engine while driving.
* This is my first T&C as I could not buy a Honda since my Accord has had 4, yes 4, transmissions and a front end repaint since being bought new in 2002.We bought the van due to transmission issues with our 1998 Tahoe with over 150000 miles, thinking we could avoid repairs for some time.
* We did test drive the stow n go 2nd row and the seat backs were just too low down for me, the top of headrest was below my shoulders so we had to go for the swivel n go anyway which are bucket heater leather seats just like the front (we have the 25L package).On the whole my wife, kids and I love the van.
"
323,2008,jeep,commander,5.5,3.6,21,17,"* Hard to see through rear window with rear back seats up, don't use it.I can't really rate the vehicle to much, since it's only been a month, so far not good.I have a 2008 jeep commander 4x4 limited 5.7 big hemi v8 its power is simply amazing and is very fun to drive.
* If you are looking for a great SUV with tons of options for a fair price and not sacrifice quality...I strongly recommend the Jeep Commander.Solid build quality, roomy, no blind spots, great Boston Acoustics stereo, solid as a tank, very fast, drivers seat moves back when key is removed, nav system easy to operate, rear camera, parking sensors, remote start, great vehicle with many features for the price.
* Sure, gas mileage isn't all that great, but who ever said you had to have great gas mileage to have a great car is stupid.
* It's just not big enough and because of this the ergonomics of the interior suffer.Instead of competing directly with the Grand Cherokee, I don't understand why jeep wouldn't ditch the Durango/Aspen and make this their full size vehicle and make it world class.
"
324,2008,hyundai,azera,5.4,3.6,15,13,"* This Azera was an answer to my prayersPurchased used from dealer (executive car with only 22K miles) It was extremely well taken care of and looks and drives brand new...still smells new!
* Gas mileage is less than impressive.I have 20,000 miles on my 2008 azera limited.
* The gas mileage averages only 2-3 MPG less than my Sonata 4-cyl.I have only 10,500 miles on this car I find it Nice to drive but not up to the standards I was expecting.
* If you're looking for a great car at a great price, check out the Azera.
"
325,2008,toyota,prius,5.4,3.6,98,83,"* Great little car.Overall we are very pleased with the prius, great mpg, comfortable seats, reliable.Just to report back that after 15,512 miles, 325.92 gallons of gas later (47.59 mpg), I still love this car.
* We will wait for the new generation of Prius with its 100 mpg possibility.Replaced an aging Jeep Wrangler with the Prius, and never looked back ... except to remove the Thule roof rack & install it on the Prius.
* It's comfortable for me to drive, I like the features (Bluetooth, nav + little extras you get) and it's great on gas mileage.
* This is the car of the future.of all the cars i have owned fro 4 cylinders to 12 this is the car that i like to drive the most.great innovations,great mileage ,and with the back seats put down,more room to carry baggage etc'than any car i have ever had.I love my new Prius!

326,2008,volkswagen,rabbit,5.1,3.6,39,38,"* I've driven Toyotas, Mazdas, Hondas and Nissans and while they've been decent cars, nothing comes close to the Rabbit in build quality, interior design, the plethora of features on a base model and best of all the sheer fun factor.Originally I was looking for an upgrade to a small SUV but couldn't find anything with pep, decent MPG, and a sticker below $25000.
* For the price, warranty, the standard extras, and fun...you can't go wrong with this car.I bought my Rabbit in June of '08 as a replacement for my '06 Nissan Frontier which was swallowing gas by the gallon and losing value faster than the Big 3 and couldn't be happier.
* My decision was between the Honda Civic and VW Rabbit, and I ultimately decided on the Rabbit as I preferred the look and it seemed more fun to drive.
* Fun to drive, great styling, and really great features for the price.I've owned this vehicle for about 2 months now and couldn't be happier.
"
327,2008,ford,explorer,3.3,3.7,7,14,"* Can't say anything bad about it!This car has been great from day one no problems very comfortable great power, turning radius, design and everything!!
* I drove the 4 runner and Pilot and they are nice but I'm very glad that I relooked at Ford they really steped up and I like the ride and feel of the Ford best, it's fun to drive!
* The V-6 fuel ecomomy isn't great but, I get the same MPG that I got with my Acura MDX and I don't have to run premium fuel.
* Yes, it could get better mileage, but again, for the money I could not find a better buy.I love this car!
"
328,2008,kia,rio,4.7,3.7,15,17,"* But in the hilly, trafficky Northeast, where I live, I highly recommend it!just bought this car, i had previously bought a 2002 model for my daughter to attend college, never drove hers' much, hers lasted so well, that i decided to buy one for myself, I am overall pleased with mine so far, but motor is a bit noisy when accelerated moderately, and suspension is a bit choppy at times , have just got 800 miles on mine so far, but it getting right at 35 mpg and this beats my dodge ram 1500 14 mpg to death.
* I bought a kia rio sedan in 2008 have had a new transmission put in to date still having problems with transmission automatic shift from park reverse or drive to revervse is very slow I am left seating in the road waiting for it transmission to shift I feel this is a safety issue and kia should correct it after many many time taking it to shop they tell me I dont know have to drive and there is nothing wrong with my car, it is the worst car I have ever had will not buy another one nor would I recommend anyone else to buy one.
* My question is Why would anyone want to buy a base model Rio when the price of a almost fully loaded one isn't much more.I bought the '08 Kia Rio because of the good gas millage and its dependability.
* Most folks replace the factory radio anyway, so this is a great approach for a custom ride.It's roomy enough for four adults, very fun to drive around town, and gets a whopping average 35 miles per gallon (50% highway, 50% city driving.)
"
329,2008,chevrolet,corvette,5.7,3.6,43,32,"* You can't open the doors with the engine running and it'll even warn you if you leave the turn signal on too long.The new 08 ls3 engine is something lot of power smooth and responsive 6 speed w exhaust package makes it fun the 3lt package and leather dresses it up as the interior can be plain needs blue tooth but overall real happy I waited for the 08 the performance handling package is great makes the ride completely different so a new toy to play with I've had my 2008 Corvette Coup, black/blackMag ride, 3LT, Nav, chrome wheels, 6 paddle auto, trans roof, for about a week now.
* We optioned, 3LT, Dual Roof, Two-Tone Interior, Crystal (daughter's name)Red, Chrome Al Wheels, Nav,.After 4 years of Corvette C5 coupe ownership I purchased a new 2008 Machine Silver Z06 based on pricing, performance and looks.
* The new c6 has a much nicer interior, much tighter and quiter ride, much better shifting and steering and last, but not least, the power of the new engine.
* At 5 years old she is already a Vette fanatic, she has good taste like her dad and mom.I have owned five Corvettes in my life, but my 2008 is the first new one I have had.
"
330,2008,toyota,yaris,6.2,3.6,104,63,"* I drive 122 miles a day, 5 days a week, total of 610 miles per week and I spent $40 on gas the first week on my commute in the Yaris, comparing to my 2004 Audi A6, which I was spending $50 every 2 days, I will probably save about $4,000 or more on gas this year because, last year I spent $6,900 on gas driving my A6 to work.
* The car hauls four full size adults in reasonable comfort and we always get comments.I got my Yaris at the end of March 2008 and have calculated mileage on every tank of gas and the MPG on every tank has been between 35 and 40 MPG.
* Gas mileage is 39 mpg when my wife drives it averaging 70-75 mph going down the NYS Thruway and about 34-37 mpg when I drive it, Fun to drive and quiet.I purchased this car 2 days ago.
* Parks like a dream (no depth perception so that's important), feels bigger than it is, good interior room, shifts great, acceleration is good, great Toyota a/c, thought dashboard design would be awkward - not, will be a great commuter car (70 miles a day).
"
331,2008,honda,cr-v,6.4,3.5,147,81,"* I drive mostly highway miles and the mileage range advertised is not for the AWD modelsReasons why I bought it: 1) Its HONDA (Quality, Reliability) 2) Interior 3) Exterior 4) Gas Mileage (NO GOOD) 5) Spare Parts available.My 2008 Honda CRV only has 29000 miles.
* For the priced it a great vehicle for those who want an SUV.Didn't know what to expect with the CRV but I must say that we have had the car for two months, and we still say to each other ""I glad we chose this one"" With the dashboard mileage reading and a little creative driving staying under 60 miles per hour I was able to get 32 miles per gallon on the Highway.
* I really wanted to Hybrid Saturn Vue, but after discovering that they were few and far between and that Saturn was having problems with the hybrid battery, I chose the Honda CR-V. Needless to say, I am VERY happy I chose my Honda CR-V EX-L. My wife has had both a Honda Civic and two Accords, and I purchased a 2000 Honda CR-V for my daughter as a college graduation present, but this is my first Honda.
* I expected the CR-V's gas mileage to be a lot less than the Scion's 32 - 33 mpg on the highway at 65 mph, but the CR-V is delivering within 1 - 2 mpg of the Scion's best mileage.
"
332,2008,volvo,c70,6.8,3.8,17,8,"* I would not even consider a rear wheel drive car.I always wanted a convertible but steered clear of soft tops - loved the old C70 but only would have purchased a hard top.
* There's plenty to love here, with a few minor annoyances: no iDock, the trunk cowl (required to be snapped down before lowering the top) could seat more securely, some don't like the back massage given by the big subwoofers behind the back seats, BLIS trips out occasionally.
* ""I have only had this car a few weeks and it has exceeded my expectations, Fun to drive, love the hard top convertible.
* Lots of power, beautiful design in and out, the best seats ever (even by Volvo standards) and best of all I can have two car seats in the back (infant and forward facing) with lots of room to spare.
"
333,2008,mazda,mazda6,5.6,3.7,23,18,"* I have driven Mazda for over 20 years, GLC's, ( go like crazy ), 626's and now a Mazda 6 my last new car.
* Glad I bought it, and saving lots of money each month!Car is beautifully equipped with Value Edition that includes alloys, 50 series Michelins, 6-cd changer, ABS, traction control, tire pressure monitoring system, split fold down rear seat, power w/dl,dual tip exhaust, and a sporty look.Just bought a Mazda6, went from a Acura TL 2004 to this but gas prices were killing me, I do miss the power of the TL's V6 but this Mazda6 is really good looking and gives me a very decent mileage.
* This is a fun car to drive, the steering is a little overboosted, but great mileage (avg 24mpg mixed), good brakes, comfortable, but a little sluggish.
* I compared to the Camry and even though the Camry its bigger with a more powerful engine and better gas mileage the pricing factor makes the Mazda a better deal, I bought mine for 16,200 and it comes with 6 discs cd changer, 17 inches rims with michelin tires, dual exhaust system, well it is pretty loaded and for 16,200 WOW!
"
334,2008,nissan,sentra,5.2,3.6,73,68,"* Great car for the price!When my parents and I started looking at cars I hated the Sentra it just wasn't what I thought I was looking for but then I test drove the Civic, Yaris, Corolla and Rabbit and finally under the encouragement of my father went to a Nissan dealership and I fell in love with the Sentra 2.0S.
* Pass through back seats are easy to use.When I decided to buy a new car that gives decent fuel economy, good performance and value of money, I chose the 08 Sentra 2.0 S. The CVT is really great to drive as there is no sudden jump into higher RPMs while merging and passing in freeways.
* We are both experienced compact car drivers and this Sentra has been a horrible disappointment.I bought this car to get better MPG and I am pleased, CVT is awesome, it's not even broken in and gets 29.9 MPG.
* This car has nice room for its size (I'm 6-4 and 36"" inseam), pretty good quality manufacture, good power, 31-33 mpg, and handling is good except I get blown around pretty good in high winds and behind semi-trucks.
"
335,2008,buick,lucerne,5.2,3.5,22,20,"* They were nice but I didn't like the idea of them saying ""the cars sell good so we don't have to drop our prices "" and another one said ""Hay , try it if you want ,or don't , I don't care "" made me realize I would try out a Buick again .
* The leather bucket seats are the most comfortable seats I've ever been in and between the seat adjustments and tilt/telescoping steering wheel the car is able to be adjusted to comfortably accommodate both me, I'm 6'1"", and my wife, 5'3"".In '06 we traded in a high mileage Park Avenue for a Chev Malibu which I regretted from day one.
* We have 9 vehicles one other 2007 and 5 restored colector cars that have all one best of show or people's choice.As a Buick owner for years now and wanting something ""different"" I went to Nissan,Toyota and Honda .
* The vehicle rides nice and handles well, and the price is reasonable for what you get.The Buick Lucerne CXL is the best Buick or car that we have ever had.
"
336,2008,cadillac,srx,4.5,3.4,10,12,"* Love the way it handles on the road - like a high speed touring sedan.The worst first: this car is the worst car on gas I have ever owned.
* Love the SRX because it handles like a well designed car and accelerates with ease.
* My wife loves the SRX and especially the black exterior I chose.This is my second srx.
* I can't believe that I enjoy this vehicle as much as I do, but it truly delivers the best of both worlds.There is nothing not to like.
"
337,2008,ford,ranger,5.4,3.7,20,17,"* I am a happy Ford Customer!If you do the reserch (actual consumer reviews)you will find the Ranger is far more reliable than the Tacoma or Chevy.Just wish it got a few more MPG's.A family member who works for Toyota has told me that Toyota's own internal quality testings show that in recent years Ford cars & trucks beats toyota's hands down!I cary apox.
* If you need an affordable, low-maintenance, reliable commuter vehicle, the Ranger is itI bought a new Ranger this year, spurred on by the crazy rebates Ford offered on this truck earlier in the year.
* This is my third Ranger ( all 99,000 miles + on each) and I hope Ford continues this line in some form as it is a winner Just bought a new 08 Ranger XLT Reg.
* Keep up the good work Ford...if it ain't broke don't fix it.I traded in a 2004 Tremor 2 door Supercab for this 2008 Sport 4 door Supercab because getting to the storage behind the seats was such a pain.
"
338,2008,toyota,highlander,6.2,3.6,116,72,"* I just keep looking for reasons to get in it and drive.I bought the limited without the awd option  interior quality & comfort excellent  performance good  gas mileage has been averaging over 21 mpg in town - - more on the highway  so far I'm very satisfied  great value for the money  have owned Toyotas before and also have a 2006 Tacoma  have found them to be very reliable.My husband and I traded in our '03 Accord to get the Highlander.
* Awesome looks, excellent power, cavernous interior (a real third row seat for two 6'4"" adults), best overall MPG for comparable SUVs, and an awesome vehicle to drive.
* Some nice added features from previous models, like the 19"" wheels, fully adjustable steering wheel and automatic rear passenger AC.When I first saw this SUV, I knew it was the one for me.This SUV is hands down the most attractive SUV in its class, with its streamlined appearance that resembles luxury SUVs such as the Cayenne or the VW Toureg, but with the low maintenance costs, reliability and resale value of Toyota.
* The ride is quiet and comfortable with plenty of room, visibility is great, plenty of power, and fuel economy for a midsize SUV is fantastic, we got 26 mpg on a trip to Florida last year.
"
339,2008,chevrolet,hhr,7.2,3.6,76,29,"* That's not customer service!drives excellent,tires keep going low,nice quiet smooth ride...easy handling..nice stock stereo,cmfo seats,adjustable armrest.I bought my HHR with 34000 miles on it the only problem i have had is the a/c it makes a funny noise when on but other than that it is great.Just purchased used hhr as second vehicle for the family.
* The only thing I disliked on this car is the window controls but that's been changed for the '09 model I think.I purchased this vehicle in May mainly due to (1) an immediate need for a vehicle, (2) a desire to get better gas mileage and (3) a very good Memorial Day weekend sale.
* The car is fun to drive and gets great gas mileage we are averaging 26 mpg after a winter of letting the car idle for 5+ minutes while it warmed and we loaded up the car seats.Good Gas mileage and decent room.
* It's reliable, great gas mileage, and it's fun to drive.
"
340,2008,chevrolet,avalanche,6.1,3.6,20,13,"* I will drive an Avalanche LTZ as long as GM can afford to make 'em.I traded in a 2003 Dodge Ram QuadCab- Laramie edition, that I purchased new for a Chevy Avalanche LTZ, with Rocky Ridge customization package.
* GM makes good trucks and SUVs, my previous vehicle was a Tahoe.For those who don't need a truck all the time, but need one occasionally the Avalanche is a perfect fit.
* There are so, so many that make it perform like it does I can't say enough good things about the 2008 Avalanche Z71.
* Couldn't be happier except I can't get my wife out of the Avalanche!
"
341,2008,gmc,sierra_2500hd,5.0,3.6,10,10,"* PS, while gas prices are high right now the purchase incentives are even higher, good time to buy a gas hog!First off, after researching diesel trucks for over a year, it was clear that the Duramax/Allison power train was the ""gold standard"".
* Fuel mileage has gone to over 23 MPG on a recent hiway only trip of 600 miles, to between 15-18 MPG back and forth to work and weekend trips.
* I'm getting about 12 mpg around town and up to 17.5 mpg highway at speeds up to 65.
* Everything is perfectI am just approaching its first 1000 miles, so 13.8 ave. mpg of the 6.0L gas engine in wet to snowy suburban/hwy driving may improve in milder/dry weather as it gets broken in.

342,2008,gmc,sierra_2500hd,5.0,3.6,10,10,
343,2008,cadillac,dts,4.3,3.4,6,8,"* '94 Deville had 175,000 miles  '99 Deville had 130,000  '05 DHS had 110,000..just got '08 DTS...these are true road warriors that have given this road warrior almost 1/2 million comfortable  safe miles...had a Lincoln in between the '99 and '05 Caddy...not even close to Caddy ride.
* GM has done an excellent job with this car.I purchased a 2008 DTS (double espresso) I like the performance on this one better than the 2004 I traded.
* i think the new one is not as quiet or smooth as the 2000, also it has that same whining noise at approx 15 to 30 mph i read about in another review, also it gets somewhat sluggish at 45 mph, no idea why it does that.
* Overall the 2008 DTS is comfortable and the engine has a lot of get up ond go.
"
344,2008,audi,a4,6.8,3.6,25,12,"* Since buying, I like the car more each day.Audi engineers are brilliant.Car handles like it's on rails,the AWD is incredible, the paddle shifters fun, driving in sport mode is a blast.It's very easy to get the speed governor to engage around 130.
* So much for Audi qualityMy first Audi (drove a 1.8T jetta for 5 years)  this is one sweet ride.
* I just picked up my new Audi A4 quattro 2.0T and can't get over this car.
* I'm trying to get Audi to get me into a brand new replacement vehicle, but they aren't budging ( they just want to fix it).
"
345,2008,mini,cooper_clubman,5.0,3.4,13,13,"* Fun to drive, have to be careful not to get too fast, ride is so smooth that speed can get away from you.Absolute joy to drive, in fact right after I bought it from the dealership and literally the first trip on the freeway- I got to test out the handling right away in order to dodge the remnants of a tire blowout on the freeway.
* You don't feel the speed, so you need to be very careful that you don't go 90 in a 55!I transitioned from a 2006 Mini Cooper S to the 2008 Clubman S, and I am really pleased with the Clubman overall.
* This car is fun to drive and you always get looks from people as you drive through the parking lot or are out on the highway.
* I've been getting about 29 1/2 MPG as a commuter with the manual transmission (still on first tank of gas), but I can easily see getting 35-40 on highway trips (I put it on cruise @ 80 and the current MPG monitor was reading 40+).
"
346,2008,gmc,envoy,6.0,3.6,9,6,"* If I had to do over again I would buy the same vehicle without the nav,We would miss the touch screen FM/XM that comes with the nav.I love my Envoy, but want to just say that I filled it up to full just two days ago and only put 120 miles on it and am already on a half tank.
* We get comments all the time on how wonderful the vehicle looks - it looks like GM hit the mark on this vehicle.
* I just bought this SUV and I knew that the gas wasnt that great, but at this rate I am going to be filling up probably every week just to get to work and back.
* Yes, the gas mileage went down with the trade, but the ride and the sense of feeling safe in a larger vehicle was worth the trade-off!I know I am not the norm, I had my previous car for 12 years.
"
347,2008,lexus,is_250,4.7,3.5,34,39,"* My only complaint is the navigation system, I don't feel it is Lexus's place to decide when I or my passenger can use the system, it greys out and can't be used while in motion no other automakers that I'm aware of do this.
* The luxurious interior and incredible audio system will help you feel better about the slow ride from 0- 60.This is not my type of car, but I must say it's great for a luxury sedan.
* IS 250 needs more power, but overall great handling, love styling, features great, excellent service and prestigious!I just bought this car.
* Picked the IS 250 because of Lexus reliability and looks.I purchased this car a week ago, what a fun car to drive!
"
348,2008,acura,mdx,5.3,3.6,57,50,"* 3/17- A/C blows hot - dealer replaces incorrectly installed refrigerant line  steering wheel shimmys during braking - dealer turns rotors  radio won't hold presets - dealer reprograms key fobs 4/7- steering wheel still shimmys under braking - dealer replaces rotors and pads  radio still not working - dealer states ""it works now"" 4/15 - radio presets disappear again - dealer replaces radio tuner 5/22 - radio still won't hold presets  Acura regional rep states ""there's no remedy""  problem is under investigation by Acura engineering  6/4 - Acura customer svc rep states they know about the problem but there's no known date when problem will be resolvedIf you are moving 4 adults, this is the best vehicle in the segment.
* Great performance inside and out, Acura did a great job building this luxury suv, anyone who likes to drive an suv this one is definitely the pickShortly after buying our MDX, we went a 2,000 mile trip, mostly freeway miles with lots of mountains, averaged 22.9 mpg.
* I plan on keeping it for a while but I don't know if I will buy an Acura again?Great ride for the buck, we love car like ride.
* Recommend the mdx to anyone looking into an SUV with the performance and luxury you get with Acura, and the reliability you can expect from Honda.The car is very comfortable even for a 6'6"" guy like myself.
"
349,2008,toyota,avalon,4.9,3.6,36,38,"* I would advise avoiding Toyota until they return to building great cars like those of ten years ago.Other than problems with the sunroof its a great car, 36 mpg on the interstate, plenty of room and a huge trunk, smooth ride, handles great..After 2 decades of Chrysler products that have great engines but rotting interior and exteriors I have decided to take the plunge...in the 3 weeks I have owned it I love it!!!
* I love the signals on the mirrors, I love the feel of the leather seats, I love the sound system, love the wood trim, love the reclining back seats, love the nav system, the blue tooth.
* Great fit and finish and the interior is like sitting in your easy chair.I seriously considered a Lexus 350 EX but the premium fuel factored with a trouble free 148K on the 2001 turned me back to the 2008 Avalon Limited.
* Previous cars include BMW 525, Mercedes E300, Chrysler 300M and we would not go back to driving any of those again for a number of reasons.Pros: Push Button Start/Stop, Mileage, Power w/6 speed Auto Trans, Roomy Cons: Soft Breaks, External Looks (there's nothing special about the design) I bought an Avalon Limited 2008 in November of 07.
"
350,2008,chevrolet,cobalt,5.6,3.6,47,37,"* Well worth the price of the vehicle.I've bought the Cobalt LT for it's good equipment package for the price especially the cruise control and a/c.
* Now I know that I am not going to be scaring any WRX or EVO owners on the roads, but as far as getting from A to B with good mileage and a nice style, it's hard to beat this Cobalt.
* Great trunk space, fun to drive, sporty look, awsome gas mileage and great power for a small engine.
* It's a nice little car for me, rides smooth (other than the brake issue), good on gas and comfy for a tall person like me.
"
351,2008,buick,lacrosse,5.3,3.5,17,15,"* After 4 trips back to fix all the scratches, 5 trips back and forth for the vibration & also a set of new tires, we still have the vibration!They are telling me that it is the road surface and not the car, we are disappointed & I will turn it in as a lemon as it is!What a disgrace to the name of Buick, just read another unhappy person's review with the vibration problem in here too, need to take some action, what is going on?
* Has a vibration problem had tires balance no help, call dealership they said new tires, don't thing that the problem, my old century and lasabre rides better than this and they had 185,000 miles.
* I love the rideBought a beautiful red Buick LaCrosse Super 2008 a month ago and it's everything I could have wanted.
* For an old man's car this one confers bragging rights.Much will be a comparison of our 2008 Buick LaCrosse vs. our 2001 Century.
"
352,2008,bmw,x5,4.8,3.4,23,25,"* Great driving, handling and comfortable car - can't imagine any other SUV driving better - drives enough like a sports sedan to make me happy and still have plenty of utility.
* Since they loaded so many things on the car which consume power, the battery wouldn't last long if you don't drive it for a while.This SUV handles the road best, compared to all the SUVs I have ever driven.
* I have owned many American and Foreign SUVs in the past, but the BMW X5 far surpasses my expectations with comfort, technology, gas economy and just plain fun to drive!I recently upgraded to a X5 4.8 with Sport Package from an 2005 Touareg V8 with the air suspension.
* I had an Acura RL which had a great system (I think it was by Alpine) BMW's will have you yelling at the car.
"
353,2008,acura,rl,3.9,3.6,7,11,"* Excellent steering and road performance.We cross shopped Audi A6, Q7, Infiniti M35x, Cadilac CTS4, Acura TL and RL, after we returned a 2006 BMW 530xiT.
* Averaged 31.8 mpg on a 2000 mile roadtrip which is the best of other cars.I bought a 2008 Acura RL in March and it's by far the best car I have ever bought.
* If you are looking for a new luxury car give the Acura RL a chance.I love my new Acura RL fully loaded.
* I previously had an Acura TL, which I liked a lot, but wanted an AWD vehicle which was a little smoother on the road than the TL.
"
354,2008,chevrolet,trailblazer,4.6,3.6,21,25,"* Great ride, plenty of power, good ride even on the long trips, good gas mileage, lots of head and leg room.
* This vehicle not only recreates the feeling of the ""SS power cruisers"" of the past - - but it has handling, ride, comfort, and convenience features that go well beyond most vehicles (car, SUV, or truck) on the road today, especially in its price-range.
* This is one awesome vehicle and is a lot fun to drive.I was a first time buyer of a Toyota product and after two years traded it on a Chevy TrailBlazer, best thing I've ever done.
* I can't feel every little crack in the road like with the Explorer, the transmission is superb with none of the problems I experienced from day one with the horrible Explorer transmission (so far, I haven't had it long).
"
355,2008,bmw,1_series,5.9,3.4,34,24,"* Great car, great ride, great BMW feel.Just traded in an '03 911 for the 135i--wow, for about half the MSRP, I think I got twice the car.
* While there's no other car that exactly compares, of all the other cars I drove the Cayman S feels the most similar - and at $20k more, it makes my $44k loaded 135 seem like an even greater bargain.Well I think I just picked up one of the 1st 135is in North America, at least it's the only one in Wisconsin!
* Overall, the car handles and accelerates well, but is a disappointment compared to the E36 M3 I drove before the 135It's fun to drive and has a good amount of power for the size of the car.
* I don't think of it as a true sports car (although the backseat is basically unusable) because it's got a great ride for a car that is so low to the ground (no sport package) and lots of nice luxury touches as well.
"
356,2008,dodge,nitro,5.2,3.4,23,21,"* I have over eleven thou on my Dodge Nitro, am very pleased with it after I took care of the things to do, I get 22 mpg in town if I stay out of it, performance is as good as most v8's, snappy,handles like a dream, Have your dealer put nitrogen in tires, retune the computer, align front end to zero, keep upkeep up & drive like you want to keep it for 15 years, my overall average is 26 combined driving city and open road.I really enjoy my Dodge Nitro, it handles really well, and is very good on gas, better mileage than I initially thought it would be.
* The roll-over factor of this suv is high and the gas mileage isn't great but those are the only two things I can find I don't like about it!I drive, a lot!
* I did not want such a large vehicle now that my little ones are getting older they need less stuff to tote around, I test drove Grand Cherokees, Dodge Darango, the new Journeys and the Equinox, nothing could compare to the exterior and interior appeal of the Nitro, especially when it came to price.
* We've also taken the Nitro on a couple of long road trips and the ride is smooth and comfortable and I love the sound of the engine when you put the pedal to the metal.I've only had mine four days but I'm in love with this vehicle.
"
357,2008,volkswagen,r32,5.0,3.6,20,20,"* Compared to other cars the R32 is above the crowd.My respect for VW's new R32 grows with every drive.
* Great integration of controls and ease of use while driving.The R32 is quick and fun to drive, but I expected more improvements over my 2004 R32.
* If I can describe the R32 in a few short words: it's a wolf in sheep's clothing.In the price range of new c300, 328i,G35 and is350, this car is truly for the VW enthusiast who doesn't mind paying a lot.
* i opted for the car without navigation.Over the years I have owned or purchased a number of performance vehicles, a short summary: 1997 BMW M3, 2001 BMW M Coupe, 2003 Honda S2000, 2006 Porsche Boxster S. I do have to say the R32 doesn't quite hit the handling and performance of some of these cars, but it does something none of them could do (with the exception of the 97 M3) and that is provide performance and practicality.

358,2008,volvo,xc90,4.7,3.8,16,18,"* People, you're talking a Volvo not a Honda, you will live through a horrific crash, you will have 311hp, this vehicle is safe, and because of that it weighs as much as much larger SUV's so the 13-18 mpg isn't that bad.
* This is another of those ""imports"" that you can buy and still buy American, Volvo is a proud member of the Ford Motor Company!Always wanted a Volvo XC90.
* Great car.......we're definitely buying it at the end of the leaseI've driven the XC90 for 20K+ miles still love it.
* I love my new 2008 XC90, but with only a V6, I thought I would get a little better gas mileage.
"
359,2008,audi,s5,6.9,3.6,9,4,"* Gas mileage is a definite concern (~12-22mpg), but only time will tell.To be a first time Audi owner with a 2008 S5 is the best car experience I've ever had.
* I have been curious of Audi as a brand for some time and the look of the new S5 was what it took to get me to go and have a closer look.
* I traded a 2007 A6 4.2 for this S5 I have driven a few cars in the last three months, A5, new M3 and my S5.
* Biggest downside is the v8 gas gulper but the car is such a joy to drive that the sub par gas mileage becomes bearable.I have had my Audi for about 3 weeks and have had many positive comments about the car.
"
360,2008,lexus,rx_400h,5.4,3.5,14,12,"* Gas mileage for hybrid is less than advertised but still I average 26.4 miles per gallon in mixed city and highway travel.
* Acceleration at all speeds is impressive  w/a light foot, gas mileage can be 29 mpg+ in city and on a good day 27 mpg+ on the highway w/cruise control active.
* Just hate the gas mileage for the price we paid.Extraordinary would be the best word that describes my driving experience in the Lexus RX400h AWD.
* We are getting better gas mileage on the highway than in the city.
"
361,2008,suzuki,forenza,3.3,3.5,6,12,"* Why go get a basic Toyota or Honda with crank down windows when you can get a Forenza for about the same price and get all power stuff.I thought this car would be good on gas and boy was I wrong!
* Not used to the zig zag on the stick, but Im ok with it now.Great lights inside, no way to lock yourself out,latch for gas cap,soft interior,MP3 is great,stereo sounds awesome,did not like the 100.00 for mats,tight over bumps, would have liked nicer rims, power windows are super fast, has the lock for window control,heated mirrorsI got hit by a person driving a Chev Tahoe on my passenger side and got pushed into the highway concrete barrier.
* With America's best warranty 7years/100,000, why wouldn't you go with the Forenza?The car performs well, and is quite comfortable - even for my 6'1"", 250 lb son behind the wheel.
* After all that I am still going to buy another Suzuki because my Forenza never put me down.The acceleration on this is terrible.
"
362,2008,chevrolet,tahoe,6.8,3.6,25,12,"* If you need the full size SUV for the family, this ride is truly great.i just bought a black LTZ and sure it is a head turner with the chrome package being standard.
* Needed more room for the gang...went from a Cadillac SRX to the Tahoe LTZ Black with chrome package - 20"" chrome wheels.
* Recommend highly...but haggle cause everybody's dumping their SUV's these days.I've had my LTZ now for about 2 months and am pretty happy with it.
* Even thought both vehicles are GM products, the Tahoe by far is definitely a better vehicle in every category, i.e., comfort, build quality, interior, exterior, gas mileage, and ride.
"
363,2008,jeep,wrangler,5.2,3.6,66,61,"* It's fun to drive and I love all the new features but I have a big problem with my hood lifting when I'm driving on the highway on windy days.Just bought a new 08 x Wrangler, I have owned over twenty jeeps, cj's, yj's, tj's.
* regarding the first problem with the leak, I brought it in and the dealer changed the rubber seal,(that didn't work), I called the dealer back and he told me that this has been a problem with the freedom top and to bring it back in and maybe I could get a one piece top that doesn't leak.
* I got the hard top wish I had the soft top also for summer looking to buy one my wife didn't want me to buy this and now she drives it more then I do going to have to trade her car in for a another one I recomend this vehicle to anyone.
* I have the hard top with removable ""T"" type tops and the Jeep is fun to drive on a nice day but I think I would take the Mountaineer back in a minute it had more power w/better fuel econ.
"
364,2008,pontiac,torrent,6.0,3.5,18,12,"* Plenty of room inside for 4 adults for long distance and 5 adults is not problem for shorter drives, rear seating has amazing leg room and front seat passenger seat has more room than the Envoy.
* This SUV is fun to drive, has enough horsepower to carry 4 good size (and then some) people without dragging its feet, and handles very well.
* I love sitting up high, it is very comfortable, I love that there is room for my purse (in the middle), it rides very nice and I just LOVE it!
* Handling, braking and ride quality are top notch as good as I have experienced in vehicles costing much more.My husband went on and on about seeing this beautiful vehicle, so we went to test drive it.
"
365,2008,suzuki,xl7,6.8,3.5,27,13,"* Great car for an amazing price.Best bang for the buck, looked at much smaller suv's with zero room behind the supposed 3rd row that's built for a dog or cat, oh and if your kids are in the third row and your hit from behind, good luck!
* It's been a great SUV and was well within my budget with all the ""bells & whistles"" a much more expensive Acadia or GMC, Tahoe or Yukon would have been.Bought the vehicle used with 9K miles on it from the dealer.
* I LOVE my XL7!I have driven this XL7 over 15000 miles in 6 months,on the highway(gets up to 80 mph like a champ),in town accelerates with the best,reliable performance every day Great Car!Wife loves it(and she drives a luxury car costing twice as much.)
* I've owned Hyundai Sante Fe & Nissan Xterra and like this SUV better than both, although the Sante Fe is also a very good value for the price.I bought my Suzuki with only 6,000 miles on it and love it so far (have only had it a couple of weeks).
"
366,2008,volkswagen,new_beetle,6.8,3.6,13,6,"* (so far )I just traded my 07 Sebring in for it (never get a Sebring) I live @ the beach so its great to take the top down and just cruise in, very comfortable, great stereo Love the SRadio that it comes with, leather heated seats this car has it all my fav car out of all the cars i have had , I would def recommend it to anyone my husband didn't like the beetles @ 1st he said it was to much of a girl car but after he drove it he loves it too , gas is av.
* The gas mileage is not as good but is so much more fun to drive.
* Could get a little better gas mileage.We purchased a 2008 ""S"" with automatic about 3 months ago for my wife, with the intent of passing it on to our daughter next year.
* I just love all the fun it is to simply go anywhere now in my new ""Sunflower Yellow"" bug.
"
367,2008,mini,cooper,5.1,3.4,25,24,"* And only two intermittent speeds.After 12000 plus miles the car is flawless..it gets better than sticker gas mileage..onboard computer displays your MPG in realtime and average...great feature...not a single problem ..average 36.5-39.5 ..it will get over 40 MPG if you drive it easy on the highway at 70...Sports car ride more firmly than a luxury car..It is incrediblely stable and safe at ""highway plus"" speeds...also has fantastic brakes..Tons of leg room..We plan to add a 2009 S Convertible so our 2008(yellow) will have a playmate...as soon as she decides on the color....If you're a car guy you'll love this car....If you not, you'll still love this car!O.K., it's cute, fit well in my garage and was truly ""fun to drive"", but the novelty for us was over for us in a big hurry.
* The car oozes character.I have only had my mini convertiable for a week and it is the best car I have ever owned in my life.. this was a 40th birtday present from my husband and he really knows how to get brownie points, when I drive this car I feel like every road is my racetrack, this car corner's on rails, it handles like a dream, it is so much fun to drive, I traded a small suv in for my mini, and i was thought i might feel a little intimated on the road, but it just moves through traffic like a dream.I sold my Ford Escape last June, and hadn't had a need for a car since my job is a mile from where I live (I know lucky!).
* First it looks cool, so much fun to drive, can go up the hill soo much faster than other cars, still gets good gas mileage..I drive somewhat fast and like to accelerate and I have an automatic turbo charged..i push that sport button and this car will fly..still average 30miles per gallon, have the mini sound system...Fun, reliable, good mpgI was on my way to purchase the Acura RDX when the Mini Clubman caught my eye at the car show and I totally fell in love.
* I love it!we bought this to fast ,it is very small inside and hard to get to anything in the back after only 6 months the dealer will only give us 19,000 trade for a 33,800 loaded mini , they told us the mini was hard to get and has a good resale value ,these were just lies to get us to buy the car if you dont mind a bumpy ride,no room inside ,or want to loose 15,000 on your car in 6 months than this is the car for you ,i learned my lesson the hard way , hope this helps you .After shopping hybrids, smart cars, and flex fuel, I opted on the Mini Cooper.
"
368,2008,jeep,compass,4.7,3.6,17,19,"* but i'm still luvin my lil JEEPGreat suv, great mileage, very roomy vehicle my family is very comfortable in this vehicle and a fun vehicle to drive 45 minute back and forth to workWhilst this vehicle is a very nice vehicle to look at the quality of the interior is terrible.
* Very smooth.I got it in Oct 2008 and I like it seeing how I own 1 other jeep before, it runs very good so far, I can not say that I like the way or how the sales people push it on me, I would change a lot about the way Cary auto park does there thing and have a lot of bad things to say about them but I do like the Jeep compass over all!Overall not bad, quiet ride.
* Good car, no problem so far, the only thing is the lights come on when lock or unlock vehicle with the remote control, kills the battery, I just bought my 08 jeep compass 2.4L Rallye Edition in black with black interior and everyone ragged on me about getting a compass until I told them that I was getting the Rallye package.
* Driving this car is fun and easy and there are no blind spots to worry about.The jeep compass is an overall ok vehicle Its design is sleek & nice but the quality of the mini SUV needs to be worked on especially with the constant stalling, cutting out etc.
"
369,2008,dodge,grand_caravan,3.9,3.4,32,51,"* Here are the problems: antifreeze leak when purchased new-- took 2 repairs, roof rack bars in wrong position and on backwards, have had 1 shock replaced, 1 strut replaced, front brakes and rotors at 29,000 mi, back electrical ""cage"" in ceiling loose, rear bumper pad replaced, still squeaks when going over bumps, wind whistling noise, doors don't always open when pushing automatic key fob.
* It has been in the shop for replacement sensor for the door, AC would shut off so they replaced internal thermostat, sensor that would tell us outside temp was replaced, front passenger seat belt unreliable and arm rest fell off and was replaced, 2 tires replaced and the icing on the cake we needed to replace the brakes at 22,000 miles.I was told by the dealer that they have been replacing alot of the breaks on this car.
* Not the best, but the price says it is Have owned it for 14 months, listed below is what has gone wrong with it so far: 1) catalytic converter replaced 2) drifts/pulls to the right 3) sliding doors don't always shut (been to shop 3 times to get right).
* I bought it for convenience since I have 3 kids & when the doors don't work or I have to stand there and make sure the doors shut it is anything but convenient.this is the 2nd dodge caravan we had and we loved the first one (a 2006) traded for this 2008 and I hate it!
"
370,2008,chevrolet,suburban,7.6,3.6,19,6,"* The kids like the heated rear seats and DVD player plus they can load all of their junk easily.A Nice ride, good mileage for a big truck, 18+ around town, 22+ highway @75 mph.
* I drive for a living and in less than a year have put 30000 miles on my truck (mostly city miles) and it still drives like new, its a work horse.
* I shopped the Escalade (overpriced), Denali (not as good looking), Expedition (not a better ride), Navigator (overpriced) and the Suburban seemed to me, the better buy .
* I will probably look into putting a small lift on it eventually as ground clearence isn't what it should be for 4x4...my 99 Silverado z71 has more ground clearence than this, but for a family vehicle, we will love it and keep it for well over 200,000 miles.
"
371,2008,dodge,challenger,1.8,3.4,3,14,"* Have one ""Big Baller"" V8 model with an MSRP of just under $40,000 and a more affordable ""Economized"" version with a V6 at around $25,000.
* I have to say that I LOVE every one of these cars but the Dodge Challenger really sticks out.
* You got me .The Dodge Challenger SRT8 is one of the sexiest new models on the market right now.
* However, comparing the 60's muscle cars to this 2008 Challenger is like comparing a manual typewriter to a modern computer.
"
372,2008,nissan,altima_hybrid,5.0,3.6,28,28,"* Have one with tech package, now have 3200 miles, still averaging about 32.5 mpg (although computer says higher) Have a second vehicle bought at same time (5 weeks ago) with 700 miles first fill up got 28 mpg (trip computer said 31.5).
* We get 29-33 mpg others say they get more, we drive 75 mph, and my wife has heavy foot.The Altima Hybrid is just a great car.
* MPG as expected, for my car up until winter was averaging 34 - 35 mpg (mostly hwy driving) My wife's car, slightly better (more (suburban stop & go).
* Over all the Nissan Hybrid is a versatile vehicle that will get you around in style wherever you go, hard to find one though.I don't have any regrets or complaints after driving the Altima Hybrid for 2 months.
"
373,2008,ford,mustang,4.9,3.7,39,40,"* Gas mileage in the V6 was a little bit better, but then I didn't drive the V6 like I do this one.This is one fun car to drive, I traded in a BMW 330 ci convertible.
* Don't know how good the fuel economy will be but I don't really care because it's a ""fun"" car that probably won't be used all year 'round.
* (2000 and older)The best way to describe the ride is to drive a dump truck with concrete wheels.Needless to say the 2008 mustang gt is not a good choice.Try the new chevy camaro,better looks and more speed.Always wanted a muscle car but got married young while my friends were driving Mustangs, Road Runners, and Corvettes.
* 350Z is nice -- but doesn't have space to put a brief case -- not as much fun and doesn't get the attention that the Mustang draws.
"
374,2008,kia,sedona,6.1,3.7,19,12,"* I think its BETTER than the 30k hondas etc.Lokks great, feels great, and you just feel safe and confident.It has great ""get up and go"", which I wasn't expecting in a vehicle this size.
* Gas mileage is not much different than was claimed 17.9 mpg combined over the last 8 months.I have always love the KIA and that was the only car I wanted we went to the dealer and I love it.
* I think KIA needs to address issues like this unless they do not care if they retain customers.....BEWARE...JUST A HEADS UP..........We've always had SUV's since we started our family.
* Thankfully, the dealer is a gem and doing everything they can to help me.We're expecting twins next month and couldn't avoid the inevitable minivan purchase (2 carseats in a Sentra just wouldn't cut it!).
"
375,2008,chrysler,pt_cruiser,5.0,3.3,12,12,"* I bought it to celebrate graduation a year ago and the only thing that bugs me about the car is that it is not really comfy on road trips.i bought a2008 car in june 2008.i always wanted a pt cruiser,finally got one.beautiful looking car,hear lots of road noise on drivers side.taken car back to dealer several times,they say they cant hear anything.taken again was told this was normal ride for pt cruiser.front end out of align when got car,was told this was a normal ride for pt cruiser.sound like my window is down all the timeand i cant take my eyes off the road.very disappointing.was out of oil,oil light never came on.good thing is get good gas mileage.gas pedal now squeaks.wiil not buy another.my daughter refuses to drive because she is afraid of too many problemsThe car runs great, handles well, nice and roomy.
* For real this time!I loved driving my used 2001 Limited Edition PT Crusier but was having some problems with it come 2007 so I decided it was time for a new one..despite the previous problems I had, I figured buying a brand new one I wouldn't have any problems, so I purchased a brand new Cruiser on January 1, 2008.
* I don't care if it's a little bit harder on the gas than some - it's far better than the SUV I just unloaded and it's way funner to drive.
* If the wife's happy everyone is happy.My first pt a brand new 2002, loved my car, had it for 7 years only two problems with it and we solved it fast,Now I have a new 2008 turbo and it has been at the dealership about 12 times, they cant find nothing wrong with it, they said its all normal, but it feels that you are riding on a tractor at the farm.gas milage is so poor,tire ligh on, the ratleling noise it makes, the squeaks andthe power seat handle broke off.
"
376,2008,pontiac,grand_prix,6.1,3.5,23,15,"* For the size of the car spins tires with ease great high speed handling would recommend to anybodyThis car is very nice the day after I bought the car I drove it from New Jersey to Florida and it drove great the whole way good power also not a whole lot but its got a lot of pep and will spin tires extremely easy had some problems with the molding under the windshield wipers but the dealer is taking care of that its got a semi sporty interior but a lot of plastic What an awesome car!
* I got mine slightly used with 9k miles on it, it MSRP for $29800, but being that its the last year for the Grand Prix and with the G8 now available, I got my GP GXP for $19000 and you can't beat that.I just purchased my 2008 Grand Prix Sedan & I am just loving it!
* Beautiful erogonomic interior...all dials and switches easy to use and read...fabulous acceleration and gas mileage....zippo maintenance...and I don't have to carry a mechanic with me or pay for his trips to Germany or Japan every few months....the GM sleeping giant has awakened...big time.
* Nice ""stock"" sound system & very nice ergonomic & (comfort) features makes this car fun to drive, pleasure to own, can't wait to drive it every day !
"
377,2008,chrysler,crossfire,4.2,3.3,5,7,"* Everyone in the office said they liked it better than the Vette, looks like my bosses 500SLK without the price, test drove one of those too and still decided on a Crossfire.
* But the price difference between the Crossfire and Vette is steep - I believe the Crossfire is a better value for the buck.
* Be careful!Had to downsize from a 06 Vette, (times are tough for realtors) Love my new Crossfire which I bought for 22k with only 1200 miles.
* If you own a Crossfire, join the Crossfire International Car Club Inc. (Google CICCI) - you won't regret it.
"
378,2008,ford,taurus_x,6.9,3.7,42,19,"* Unless you need minivan space, otherwise this is a great family vehicle.I traded a 2005 Freestyle for this program 2008 Taurus X and other than the gas mileage being worse the car is much improved, the ride is so much better and to me that more than offsets the difference in the gas mileage.
* The Taurus X's transmission is very smooth, the ride is very quiet and the engine is very peppy.We have 2500 miles on the X and it is so much fun to drive.
* Although at first I was a bit bummed when the wife said she would rather have the Taurus X than the AWD Limited Edge we both really loved, I am happy to say that I am very glad I bought her a Taurus X.
* there is even enough room for a decent amount of stuff with the seats up.Owned a Honda Pilot and the Taurus X by far is a better vehicle.
"
379,2008,mazda,mazda5,6.3,3.7,50,29,"* My wife, who always swore she would never drive a minivan, loves it so much that she now wants to learn how to drive a manual so that she can drive my car instead of her CR-V. Our baby loves it too :) The 5 is so fun to drive that I feel like I'm driving a sporty car, not a Micro-Van - great mix of fun and practicality.Traded down (size wise) from a Chrysler town and country, also have Jeep Cherokee and Mazda miata.
* Cons: non-lighted mirrors, small useless cubbies without lids, industrial looking fabric, door ajar light doesn't specify which door, gas cap is very hard to get off, wimpy horn, can't close windows with car off, small sunroof, would switch volume with placement of radio change buttons (don't change volume often, but you always change stations, add on/off button), cubbie under middle seat can't be accessed while driving, sunshade is too short-useless, light in truck have off/on/door, armrest must be up to access back.
* The gas mileage rocks, very hard to find a sporty vehicle that fits the whole family and gets great gas mileage!
* Wanted to find a vehicle with a 3rd row so my wife could sit with the kids on long trips and entertain/distract them while I drive but still get decent gas mileage.
"
380,2008,toyota,4runner,5.2,3.6,25,23,"* Great build quality, excellent ride (even with the XREAS suspension, which firms up the ride just slightly, but it handles great in the corners), good brakes, comfortable seats (I am 6 ft 1 and fit easily) - couldn't be happier.
* Don't know why I waited so long to get one.I chose the 4Runner Sport V6 RWD based on reliability and looks despite the RAV4 Sport V6 getting better gas mileage and sports-car like performance.
* Went looking for an SUV at a Chevy dealer and bought a Toyota 4runner, we were so impressed with the vehicle and I (male) love looking at it in the driveway as well as driving it.
* Could have gotten a much better deal on the Nissan but just couldn't do it.Having previously purchased other makes and models (this is my first Toyota), this car is excellent.
"
381,2008,audi,rs4,4.2,3.6,5,7,"* I enjoyed Herb's comments on this car, obviously he's never driven an RS4 and must dislike Audi.
* For me personally the best attribute about this car is that it's not flashy and only Audi enthusiasts really know what sort of beast I am driving.
* Nontheless it's an everyday performance sedan that you can actually accommodate passengers in the back seat, yet alone have enough space for just about anything with an extensive amount of trunk space.I purchased the 2008 RS4 in July 07 and took delivery toward the end of October 07.
* I recently just purchased a 2008 Audi RS4 roughly 3 weeks ago and just absolutely love it!
"
382,2008,infiniti,fx35,5.2,3.6,17,16,"* Everything else is well thought out  quiet ride and so far performed very well with no trips to the dealer!t's the nicest looking SUV out there, it's a blast to drive, and even the bare bones model comes with everything I need.
* We test drove the Nissan Murano, but the feel was different than the FX, I like the fact that the FX iss a rear wheel drive.
* Drove the BMW X6- nice but small, heavy, overpriced and lacks the fun to drive factor Love the FXs comfort, size, quality, sporty drive, high end finishes, feel of the wheel and those seats.
* If you don't put your foot into it, you can do OK with gas consumptionHave had this vehicle for a month now and love the look of it, love the way it drives, and love the respect I get on the road.
"
383,2008,honda,odyssey,4.8,3.5,57,62,"* Navi great, seats great, maneuverability great for van, entry/exit seat height great, noise control OK, front suspension OK, mileage better than SUV, exterior looks great, gauge legibility great, headlight projection great, dash design dated (think JDM), interior plastic too cheap.
* Fun to drive: It's a Minivan, how much fun is it driving a Minivan, it's not a sports car.I purchased this brand new and at first I did not want a minivan, but I've found I like the convenience of it.
* Comparing the odyssey touring edition without pax tires (do not recommend pax tires) vs. the sienna limited edition here are the pros and cons of each: Odyssey: Pros: Front load dvd player, good storage, middle seat in second row, better layout of buttons for opening side doors, power rear lift button (not a strap that needs to be pulled) Cons: Seats are not very comfortable, brakes not as responsive and strong, fuel economy The first 3 months, this van was in the dealership off and on for 7 weeks.
* and Good on gas mileage compare to other van.After several years of owning Toyotas, )'95 Camry, '01 4Runner, '04 Matrix), we traded in the Matrix after we realized we couldn't get three car seats in the Matrix.
"
384,2008,ford,expedition,5.6,3.7,22,17,"* My wife is the primary driver and loves it already!Over the last couple of months I've had so much fun offroading the Expedition taking it to long distance trips it cannot get any more comfortable it already is it feels as if they used Nasa cushion in the chairs any ways i'm happy with my Expedition and I'm planning to keep it for a long time.
* This one is a 2WD EL Limited and I must admit I like it better thatn my others, it has a softer ride, feels heavier and is a little better on gas ( maybe the 6 speed ).
* I have been getting 12 MPG around town and 22+ when I drive only freeway miles It comes with many great standard features for a base model and has the same engine and transmission as the Eddie Bauer or Limited versions.
* 6 speed transmission very smooth and low revving.I gave my Expedition ""10"" scores throughout for a reason  For a large SUV, one cannot expect to get 25 MPG.
"
385,2008,scion,tc,5.9,3.9,39,27,"* Decent gas mileage and great radio... And gotta love that price tag =)love it how ever it needs more powerJust love my 2008 Scion tC.
* I don't really have anything bad to say besides the fact that it doesn't come with great tires.I compared similar models in the tC's price range (Mazda3, Honda Civic, Nissan Sentra) and found this to be the best bang for the buck, very well equipped, and lots of room for modifications.
* Great features for the price, fun to drive, great body styling!Overall, very good quality for the money.
* I tell everyone I know about how much I enjoy driving this car.I love the looks,the car attracts a crowd anywhere it's parked.Although it's not a sports car, it's fast enough to be fun to drive.The sun roof is my favorite feature (feature not option).
"
386,2008,lexus,rx_350,4.6,3.5,22,26,"* And it's all about her.My wife and I love our Lexus RX 350, an amazing blend of ideal traits providing the utility of an SUV, exceptionally smooth driving experience, startling acceleration for an SUV, incredible gas mileage for an SUV (we're averaging 23.5 mpg in mixed driving), very smart interior layout with little extra touches like the extra retractable cup holder to the left of the steering wheel in addition to the console cup holders.
* The Lexus should prove to be a great value!I recently purchased a new RX 350.
* It's so versatile without compromising performance, safety, quality, or comfort.Let me preface by saying that my wife and I have owned several different cars (3 hondas, 1 nissan, 1 lexus, and 1 bmw).
* The RX 350 is a smooth and quiet ride with good acceleration when on the move.
"
387,2008,scion,xb,6.8,3.9,126,59,"* it's really fun to drive but have not gone a long trip yet, gas mileage at first was alright until i put a cold air intake went up about 2 miles per gallon (as long as i don't get in it)I upgraded from my 2007 ""2006"" xb.
* Though not as much as the first generation xb (really boxy one) you still get a lot of people staring there is nothing quite like it one the road and that makes it so great!
* The 08 xB looks less like a box, has more features, more power, is fun to drive, and gets fewer MPG than the prior xB models.
* went to my local scion dealer, had the chance to test drive the tc then the xb really like the tc but needed room and the xb had what i needed for my five dogs.
"
388,2008,audi,a6,5.8,3.6,15,11,"* It was great in the snow and handles like a sports car on the dry pavement.I was in the market for an all-wheel drive german executive car, so my choices were the MB E350 4Matic, BMW 535xi, or the Audi A6 3.2, and I went with the Audi.
* The cabin is very quiet, so you can really enjoy the great sound system - great improvement from the Audi Symphony system in my 2001 A6.
* Great car all around.With this car I am fully in control and it grabs the ground like an ice pick to ice, the growl of the engine just makes you wanna go faster and faster, this car is by far better than any BMW out there, with its AWD platform you can make curves like they were straight lines.We researched, watched and waited for just the right sedan to come to market.
* This is the Audi/German luxury This is my 2nd Audi A6 and the 2008 sure does beat out my old '00 A6.
"
389,2008,saturn,sky,6.4,3.5,18,10,"* Was recently at a car museum's roadster exhibit and people were looking at my Sky!An impressive auto that's great fun to drive.
* For what I use it for it's perfect, just don't get one if you expect to fit more than one other person and a small overnight bag!This is a great car to drive.
* Cannot believe how much fun it is to drive, you just go looking fot the windest roads you can find to put the car through its paces.
* It's fun to drive and the enjoyment factor is way high.
"
390,2008,toyota,matrix,6.2,3.6,16,10,"* They finally fixed a minor rumble/rattle from the back that I lived with the first year, and it looks like new and suits me to a T. I bought it specifically for hauling things with the seats down, and it's great - the cargo nets help a lot.I needed the most fuel efficient car I could find that could still carry a bunch of stuff.
* Great car all around, comfort is ok, like others, back seat can be a little more confy and I have to issues with the driver side.
* It's just a basic car - no bells and whistles, but it's comfortable and, being a Toyota, I'm expecting it to be around for a long time.
* The most enjoyable is going to Home depot etc and being able to put back seat down and use all the back room for a vehicle of this class.
"
391,2008,ford,f-350_super_duty,3.9,3.7,16,25,"* 11mpg empty.Quieter than my 6.0, but seems to have less torque, fuel mileage is 1-2MPG less than my 6.0, has plenty of power to pull 39' horse trailer and hauling 15 rolls of hay, seats are still not comfortable and have been since 2002 models, sides of front seats push in at the hips and cause discomfort after a few hours of driving, Ford still needs to redesign front seats, vibrates at take off, worse when pulling loads, bumpers are the pits any more on new trucks, they are nothing more than cosmetic like car bumpers, Factort Continental brand tires stink, rubber gets gummy and peals in hot road conditions, they are worn out by 30,000 miles, Ford can do better on a 50,000 truck.
* (about 12.5mpg with 2000 miles on the truck) Haven't had any blue smoke like I read from others, also with the new emission regulations the Cummins and the Duramax aren't getting much better mpg compared to the Ford, so blame Washington for that!
* Ford has succeeded with a very stylish and impressive truck!In my 1 week of ownership I have found my new F350 Diesel to be a great vehicle: fast off the mark, looks good, and decent economy for such a large vehicle.
* No diesel will give best fuel economy till at least 5000 miles.I just picked up my fully loaded '08 diesel F-350 long bed dual rear wheel beauty one week ago and I have already gotten tons of compliments on it (at least one a day.)
"
392,2008,toyota,camry_hybrid,6.4,3.6,42,24,"* At first I didn't think it was getting all that good gas mileage at around 30 mpg, but now I get around 36.8 mpg @ 72ish on the highway, and in town 37 to up to 42 mpg.
* The key to getting great gas mileage on a hybrid is to avoid jack rabbit starts and keep your speed down.I love this car, but I have used it mainly for city driving, with a long shallow upwards grade when I go north and a lot of stops, and it is a struggle to keep mileage above 30 MPG.
* It started in the coldest of weather and even though I commute round trip 100 miles per day (i.e., mostly interstate driving), I rarely get less than 46 mpg highway and have many times reached 65-78 mpg in city driving (my hubby once got a tank avg.
* Camry hybrid is a wonderful ride and drive!I test drove both the Altima Hybrid and the Camry hybrid before buying.
"
393,2008,dodge,charger,5.7,3.4,35,26,"* It will take me a while to get used to being back in a car, but I can't think of a better car to choose as my first in many years than the 2008 Dodge Charger R/T.I only have the base model Dodge Charger, but I love it.
* car was in accident hit front by an suv car took total impact and side door on drivers side hit and I walked out of the car without a scratch i was going about 15mph slowing to make turn in rain.AWD kicked in and i was untouched dash was totally in tack airbags went off would like to find another AWD Charger This car saved my life it was a beauty had leather interior/sunroof red with a black racing stripe I loved it Great gas mileage we drove from Allentown, PA to Scituate, RI on one tank of gas!
* Even though I've only had it a couple of days...I don't think I'll ever get rid of this car.I'd like to say that this is a great car, but we will go with good for now.
* Looks kind of like a great white shark at the front - love it's tough look!
"
394,2008,toyota,sequoia,6.2,3.6,63,38,"* Overall our family is very happy with our choice of this comfortable fun and functional SUV.I have a '92 Camry that I bought new 16 yrs ago and a '99 Sienna I bought new 9 yrs ago so I expected the Sequoia to be another ""quality"" Toyota and, 1,100 miles into this new vehicle, I have not been disappointed.
* Build quality looks solid.This is my second Sequoia, the first is now in my daughter's hands and she loves it, I got the '08 when she got my old one and although it took a little getting used to, it's a superior vehicle to any other SUV I've owned, Ford and GM.
* It handles great (not like the 5,900 pound SUV that it is), looks great, and the time is right to buy.Now that I have had my Sequoia for a few months, I can honestly say for such a big vehicle it handles very smoothly.
* I don't love the changed front end (too Tundra-ish), but I love the interior - from the 2nd row Captain's chairs to the power 3rd row roomy bench seat.
"
395,2008,hyundai,sonata,5.6,3.6,56,44,"* This is my first time owning a Sonata by Hyundai, I've owned a lot of cars over the years, and I have to say that this car rides smoother than any 4 cyl I've ever owned, the ride is smooth pick- up is great the trunk is very large.
* The Infinity sound system's subwoofer is mounted in the cardboard deck behind the rear seats and creates an annoying distortion even at low volume.We like Hyundai products so well we began buying one each year them in 2006, currently owning two Limited models Azeras we drive for total luxury and comfort and a third standard transmission Sonata I drive back in NY as my Summer toy, and we appreciate and enjoy each one!
* After researching and test driving Honda Accords, Toyota Camrys, and finally the Sonata Limited, it was clear that for the money, I was able to get luxury with the Sonata that I wouldn't get with other 2.
* Otherwise he car has been great, drive lots, runs great, could have an oil life monitor, more headroom, and a power passenger seat, next car will.I've had my Hyundai Sonata Limited for a little more than a month now, and I am loving it.
"
396,2008,ford,escape,5.5,3.7,77,64,"* It was worth the money I paid.I've been pretty happy so far with my purchase, it's loaded with everything, it handles great on icy and snowy roads, stereo is OK, could be lots better, comfort isn't too bad, seats could be softer, I did have problems with a exhaust sensor, and the roof rack always rattling, got that fixed great small SUVI purchased an 2008 Escape because I need something with a little more and still got good gas mileage and I found it.
* Will not buy a Ford again.I just bought my escape and i totally love it, from the inside out, i like thats its a suv so i can sit up higer and see traffic better as apposed to being in a car being short and all its kinda nice i can also get in and out easily with out having to do the ole heave ho action getting into my suv, it rides smooth over speed bumps and on the road.
* If I didn't come from a Ford family, I would not buy another Ford vehicle.While I have had mine for only a week I can say I am in love with it.The reviews say it is slow 0-60,I say its not ""race day"",Acceleration suites me just fine.Other reviews state not enough power but those are the ones that bought it with a 4- cylinder..C'mon people,you dont buy this kind of vehicle with a 4-cylinder and expect the same power as a 6- cylinder..it wont happen.The sacrifice is the better mileage for less power.Personally,a 4-cylinder should stay where it belongs...in ""sardine cans"".
* plus its easy to drive i dont feel like im driving a boat it feels like im driving a car but im up a lil higher i highly recomend this suv to anyone!I researched this vehicle thoroughly, and was so happy when I finally purchased it.
"
397,2008,subaru,impreza,5.5,3.7,78,65,"* AWD is great, and over the 15K miles, I've gotten 26 MPG overall-- which I think is really good considering the AWD and larger 4-cyl engine.
* I traded a ford ranger truck in for my Subaru.Yeah, the handling isn't tight as my old 2.5 RS Impreza but its almost as much fun to drive with a much improved ride, a good tradeoff if you drive on rough roads.
* Overall great car but averages about 17-21 mpg so gas can get pricey.It's a love it or hate it new body style and I love it!
* I am very happy with my selection, its driveability and (of course) its AWD and great handling (better than the Legacy).This car is a lot of fun to drive, and if your drive normally pits you against the elements, it is especially worth considering.
"
398,2008,chevrolet,equinox,6.0,3.6,45,30,"* Coming from a Mustang GT boss to this is a like a different world It is very easy to drive and doesn't even feel like your driving a small SUV.
* Only low note, is that I wish fuel mileage was 2-3 mpg better - but who doesn't?After test driving suv's from Honda Pilot, Fords Edge, GMC Acadia, Saturn Vue, we decided on the Chevy Equinox.
* Realistically, I'd probably get 21 if I drove like I used to do when gas wasn't gold plated, but if we can put a man on the moon, surely we could design one that gets 30 mpg.
* Overall a great purchase.We upgraded to the leather interior because the cloth interior was less comfortable and did not look like it would last long.
"
399,2008,acura,tl,6.6,3.6,75,38,"* However the TL is bigger than all of these cars and actually the size of the Lexus GS & M45.Came to the dealer looking for a TSX, Ended up going home with the TL type S. Amazing ride for a performance veichle, love the aggressive look.
* When you compare this to a 3 series BMW you will find 40K plus to get close to the standard equipment on the TL, and that is with BMW's standard ""leatherette"" interior without upgrade.
* The Acura is actually more fun to drive, has more room, you get the ""all-inclusive"" package when you get the Type-S vs BMW everything is ""a la carte"".
* Like a previous post I too was at first disappointed by the car's jerky transmission, however after a few months of ownership this car's drive seemed to transform (or I got more accustomed) to very smooth, fun car to drive.
"
400,2008,hyundai,tiburon,5.0,3.6,22,22,"* The exterior is outstanding, looks great, nice lines, dule exhaust, projector head lights, 17"" wheels, and it all comes with the best warranty in the business, mine has the remaining 4 years which is still better than GM or Ford.My tiburon has 16000 miles and I bought it brand new.
* The Tiburon GS is a great little coupe that looks a LOT better then most coupes in its price range.
* The ride is great and the gas mileage is very good - about 23 mpgThis car is fun to drive!!!
* My buddy has a 3-series Bimmer and I can't help rub it in that my car is less than half the cost of his car and looks just as good!Fun to drive, I live in Hawaii and we have a lot of mountain roads.
"
401,2008,cadillac,cts,5.8,3.4,73,52,"* The 2008 cts, 3.6 d.i., all wheel drive, handles as good, and ride quality is superior to the V. I have to admit, that I love this new cts better than the cts-v. interior is comfortable, the exterior is beautiful!
* I've owned new BMW 5, new BMW 3, and new Audi 6 and the new 2008 CTS not only belongs in this class but outshines them all with ext/int design and features.
* I love this car...it's the best 4 dr sport sedan I've owned and if Cadillac continues to deliver quality and VALUE there's no reason to go back to BMW, Audi, or consider others like Lexus.
* CTS is more comfortable, more ""gadgets"", more fun to drive, turns more heads than my STS ever did.Baby boomer who's never owned a new American built car (or any American car other than the old Pontiac I had in high school).
"
402,2008,mitsubishi,outlander,6.1,3.7,34,22,"* On road trip car is outstanding just sit back and put on Cruise and front wheel drive (28 mpg) around town not impressed with mpg or noisy motor, like all available features (best bang for buck).
* I would not buy another Mitsubishi because of this.I owned a 2005 XLS and loved driving all 101k miles that I decided to give that one to my MIL and buy myself a new 2008 with all the new features!
* The car's sound system is also good, and I don't have to buy anything extra just to enjoy my cd's.
* Driving it gives me a headache and my clothes absorb an ""odor"" (been ionized 2 times in service no change), steering wheel noises with right and left turns, other things but the big one is I need a new transmission which I am now waiting for (for a new car!).
"
403,2008,lexus,is_f,4.4,3.5,8,10,"* Disadvantage - resale value lower than M3 (not C63) even though ""exclusive IS-F"", M3 and C63 are more fun to drive, better build quality, and better handling than IS-F. No manual trans vs. M3 (not C63), slower than M3 and C63 (not much diff.
* The ride is a bit firm for rougher chip roads (which we have a lot of here in New Zealand) but the electronics are faultless, the bellow of the car great and it does all that I hoped it would do - I am a Lexus convert!I had 2 M3s and 1 C55 and I did test drive all new M3, C63, and IS-F.
* I was debating between the M3 and this, but after reviewing reliability histories and the true price difference AFTER options, I decided on taking a gamble on Lexus's new fastest car.
* The torque, the engine sound, even the automatic transmission was great (in manual mode it can shift really fast).
"
404,2008,audi,tt,5.6,3.6,18,14,"* I was hoping it would work well like the 2004 TT I leased for 4 happy years.I first saw the Audi TT on the road and immediately started to do my research.
* I could go on, but suffice it to say it's a truly exceptional experience to drive!I've had the new Audi TT Roadster for around 2 weeks and it is by far the best car I have ever owned!
* Obviously the first TT almost made me a die-hard TT fan, but there have been considerable improvements to the new generation, such as a larger trunk (no lie: it can manage two gold bags), a better top, great GPS and customizable computer.
* Love the headlights, tail lights, interior, exterior, and 10 spoke bicolor rims that stand out.I have been driving my 1995 Audi 90 for over 13 years when I upgraded to a slightly used 2008 Audi TT.
"
405,2008,kia,spectra,5.5,3.7,24,20,"* Great gas mileage thus far ,worst MPG so far 28.79 mpg on the first tank (best 33.06 mpg last tank 1806 miles).
* Love the 7500 mile oil changes, and of course the great warranty!With now 2000 miles under its belt, I would like to say this was a great purchase.
* I've never gotten worse than 27 mpg and have gotten as good as 38, and trust me, I don't drive like an old woman and that's usually with the AC on too.
* All in all, It's been a great car, got more options for less money and it doesn't look like a pregnant roller skate!
"
406,2008,dodge,ram_pickup_1500,6.3,3.4,36,21,"* Verdict I'm glad I got a dodge hemi.I love my truck I've own this truck 10 month and have no problem with the truck, only thing I didn't get the lift time, bought the truck and two weeks later they came out with the lift time warranty, can't beat a Dodge truck.
* It is not terribly slow, but patience is required.I have had my truck for a couple of months, I have always admired the look of the dodge trucks, so I took the chance and purchased one, my concern was if the 4.7 L engine had enough power to tow my 6k 27ft travel trailer up these Colorado mountain passes, truck tow this camper with no problem, more power for towing than I thought, my wife thinks it towed better than our silverado did, and I would agree, great truck lots of great comments for strangers, neighbors, and all my Navy co workers.
* It's ok just cruising around, but sometimes lack power when going uphill or when passing.So far I owned brand new, a 1996 ram, 2001ram, 2006ram, and now 2008 ram big horn.
* I have taken my RAM off road many times and it handles great, food ground clearance and great power for moving up and down the rock beds.
"
407,2008,honda,s2000,5.0,3.5,6,6,"* Honda created a winner with the 2000 and although it's production run is ending in this model year (09) this car will live on as one of the few remaining true sports cars on the road today, and one which I will own till I give up my license due to old age!This car is a poor man's world class car.
* There's no downside to the S2000 if one uses it for what it was designed, a true, absolutely uncompromising, sports carThis is MY 3rd Honda (and my wife drives an '05 Accord EX).
* The S2000, is much more fun than the Z, has a better road feel and is easier to drive.
* Here is a true sports car in every sense with high-tech handling and more power than all but the most experienced sports car guy can handle.
"
408,2008,ford,f-150,6.3,3.7,32,19,"* This truck drives like a dream and has hauled great!Well my first truck was a 2008 Toyota Tundra with the 5.7 liter, 381hp, I traded the Tundra in for a 2008 FX2 F- 150 SuperCab 4.6liter, the Ford by far in my oppinion is the better truck, I love the smooth quiet ride, steering, the leather captains chair, Ford has been making trucks a lot longer than Toyota, Ford knows how to build a reliable truck, I paid $24,000.00 for a truck that MSRP at $34,500 and it is loaded, Thank God for Ford.
* Fuel economy cold be much better, and it is costly to drive these days, but as a owner of a single cab 02 V6 F150, then upgrading to this 5.4 V8, I can see that Ford did get better in its fuel economy, but hey, if you drive such a big truck, you better expect the gas to be high.
* The dealer was great to work with and provided a great deal in addition to Ford's great rebates.
* Doesn't have the get up and go like my old Titan, but the Titan was proving to be a repair nightmare and seemed like something was always wrong with it.After having exceptional luck with my first F150 (98 4x4 that is still going strong), as well as after test driving a Tundra, Silverado, and Dodge, I decided to get another F150.
"
409,2008,chrysler,aspen,5.6,3.3,24,19,"* The Hemi is strong and overall he looks are outstanding.I love the ride it looks great, has everything you could possibly need in a vehicle for about $10,000 less than other SUV's.
* I have been out looking at SUV's for over six months and overall with interior and exterior features along with the Hemi under the hood I couldn't pass this one up for the what you get for your money.
* It's quality is as good, if not better, than the aforementioned SUV's, but about 8-10k less.This is the only SUV I have ever owned that gets better and better each and every time I drive it.
* The gas is what I expected (avg 16.3 mpg) Of course I would love better gas (but for what I am getting, I can live w/the gas price).
"
410,2008,acura,tsx,5.7,3.6,30,23,"* It has plenty of power for surface and freeway driving, decent gas mileage (23 mpg), great handling, and super nice interior.
* My notes are as follows  allow a break in period as it is required to get to peak performance, 65-70 on a flat trip you will get well over 30 mpg, the car does turn heads, the leather on the seats creases easily, the kick plates will chip quickly, and it is well worth it to add a cold air intake.After a 92 and 98 Accord, I decided to upgrade to the Acura TSX.
* I have had the TSX only for 700+ miles and it's very fun to drive with more creature comforts than any competitor and I'm getting 32.6 actual MPG in 80% hwy/20% city Boston commuter traffic.
* :)My TSX is a great sports sedan that has enough room to carry 4 adults but still small enough for efficient daily commuting with only the drive.
"
411,2008,ford,explorer_sport_trac,6.0,3.7,12,8,"* Very smooth ride, If you're looking for something like this no other manufacturer can even come close to the quality and comfort of the Sport Trac.I will always need some type of truck for hauling and have liked the Sport Trac since the first ones came out.
* I am not dissappointed with the mileage, but I think Ford could do better.I traded in my '97 Ford F-150, which was the best vehicle I had ever owned.
* It's the same mileage my CX-7 got and that thing didn't have anywhere near the room.I traded in a 2004 F-150 and got 2008 Limited Sort Trac, V8, 4X4, limited chrome and electronics.
* MPG could be improved, so far getting 16mpg but would prefer if Ford could up that to 20.
"
412,2008,mitsubishi,lancer_evolution,4.6,3.7,13,15,"* Go drive it Well I got a bad one, and started out on the wrong foot, I still dearly love my car, but at 1143 miles I required a new transmission.
* Interior is so so if you got the base model, but an EVO is made for driving not luxury.I had this car for 1 year now and still love the drive feel of the car.
* I've had 2003 WRX so this GSR's tranny isn't that much of a complaint to me.I bought my Evo and had it shipped across the country without ever test driving it.
* For the cost and driving fun I think it is a great value PLUS it seats 5 and I can take the kids and wife every blue moon to keep her content.
"
413,2008,mercedes-benz,s-class,5.7,3.6,16,12,"* The S Class has more steel interior parts than Lexus LS & is just a better handling car.Is it possible to have luxury, comfort, superb build quality, and safety in one car?
* I've owned many performance cars: CL500, Porsche 911's, BMW 7 series, Lexus LS430 etc..
* I've owned many performance cars: CL500, Porsche 911's, BMW 7 series, Lexus LS430 etc..
* The S550 is a remarkable automobile.I have owned many new cars incuding 9 new Sclass mercedes.
"
414,2008,ford,f-250_super_duty,6.4,3.7,36,20,"* Excellent power and refinement.Having owned over 10 Ford trucks this one is by far the best overall.Diesel has solid power and is very quiet.Fuel economy is currently 17 mpg on highway, 13 city and 12-14 highway towing a 9000 lb.
* By far the best Ford I have owned.I have owned Ford F-250's since the 70's, usually buying a new one with every body change.
* Dodge, GMC & Chevy aren't even in the same leaguewith this beautiful beast.I have 3500 miles on this truck and im averaging 16 to 17 mpg in town and over 20 mpg on the highway with no mods except I use diesel kleen in the fuel.
* The 2008 diesel has a lot of power but terrible fuel econony - and that's and understatement.They moved the engine into the cab resulting in less room in the interior - no back seat room for the third person.
"
415,2008,saturn,outlook,5.4,3.5,45,38,"* The Outlook has a great look and I love the interior especially with the heated leather seats, sunroof, and captain chairs, Nav,etc...However I am extremely disappointed in the performance, there is no power climbing a basic hill, my foot is on the floorboard of the accelerator..The gas mileage stinks...I am averaging 12 mpg, I thought I was smarter than the Chevy Tahoe crew because the Outlook bragged about performance and good mileage..False ratings or something is dramactially wrong with this car...I drive rather conservatively, so I just don't get it.I went from a Dodge full size van and this is my perfect match.
* DON'T WALK RUN FROM THIS NIGHTMARE - LOOKS AREN'T EVERYTHING!vehicle rides good but needs more power.I have brought it to the dealership 3 times with under 7,000 miles for a transmission problem,and they keep telling me all the codes are good.It feels like the trans is slipping and it over revs during shifts on the highway This is without a doubt the most comfortable vehicle I've ever owned.
* The only problem I have or don't like is getting to the third row seating, it's a bit hard and I wish i would have opted for the captains chairs in the second row, but over all I love it!This is easily the best car I've owned.
* I have tried out every channel on my XM and I love the fact that the radio downloads local radio stations so I don't have to search the airways.This is the best car I have ever owned and its a Saturn!
"
416,2008,bmw,3_series,4.9,3.4,68,72,"* Didn't go for the nav, bought a Garmin nuvi (noticed BMW also sells Garmins with the BMW branding).Great car, has the performance to wow anyone that rides in the passenger seat and the luxury that BMW is known.This is my 4th BMW.
* BMW's got amazing gear ratios, an engine that responds at cruising rpm to accelerations and it sure turns heads!I have been reading reviews and have been driving BMWs for years now but despite how good everyone said this car would be it doesn't sink in until you pull it off the lot.
* If you want speed coupled with amazing handling then don't look any further.This is our family's first BMW, and what a terrific car it is.
* It's beautiful to look at both in and out, and I now understand why the BMW Client Advisors talk about BMW luxury being built around the performance.
"
417,2008,nissan,rogue,6.8,3.6,143,67,"* Dash very smart, simple and sporty, all gauges easily readable, acceleration more than ample, car feels like going slow at 65 mph, tried paddle shifters, fun but not necessary, grey with grey interior, beautiful and classy, wife so happy with car, never saw her like this with a new car, she loves the look, the feel, the comfort.
* The Rogue is a very attractive SUV we traded our 2005 Pathfinder in for the Rogue mainly for better gas mileage We have now owned our Rogue for about 3 weeks during this time we took it on a 800 mile road trip it seemed to perform and handle quite well we did notice that on rougher stretches of highway we had some vibration and rattling not what we were use to on the way to our destination we averaged about 22 MPG due to heavy winds part of the way and on the way home about 26.5 MPG not bad but I was hoping for a little better mileage.I purchased my Rogue on 7/12, trading an '01 Toyota RAV4.
* Nissan's aren't the smoothest ride but very comparable to Honda and Toyota and the Nissan 4 cylinder on cruise does maintain highway speeds and climbing hills much better.This car is truly a value.
* Live in indiana and handles very well in the snow.I like everything about this car except for the gas mileage which is not unexpected considering the size of the car, and the gas tank which has no inside release.
"
418,2008,audi,a3,6.1,3.6,17,11,"* Audi doesn't want you to know this, but the back seat in the A3 is bigger than that in the A4.
* I thought I had escaped that fate as the first year was great  lot's of fun to drive, average 32.5 mpg overall, reasonably peppy and good brakes and handling.
* If you're looking at a cheap BMW 3 series, but don't want to spend $38K to get the options you want, but don't want to settle for a VW, then this is the car for you.
* Great engine  amazing transmission  handles like it's on rails.
"
419,2008,chevrolet,impala,4.5,3.6,53,64,"* For the money it is still a great value and I get tons of compliments on its looks!If you never drove a Honda Accord, Mazda 6, Camry, or Nissan Altima, the Impala might seem like a great car.
* I have over 2500 miles in one month and am just under 20 mpg's with mixed driving.I am in sales and will do another review as the mileage piles on.Every morning I go out to my car to begin the day's journey to work, a situation that will put a frown on most people's faces.
* Nice sized truck, good power to pass on 2 lane roads, very good fuel mileage for the size of car, good comfort.
* Havent had the chance to use E85, not that it really matters to me, although great mileage for the size and driving conditions ~27 MPG avg would definitely recommend, especially with the great leasing options.
"
420,2008,infiniti,g37,5.4,3.6,38,33,"* Prior to the G37 coupe I was driving the BMW 525i and prior to that the BMW 325i and I can tell you that the G37 coupe is more fun to drive and has more options than the comparable BMW for considerably less money.
* Any person looking for a new coupe needs to consider the G37 because I believe you will be pleasently surprised that you will get so much car in this market segment for the price.The newly redesigned G37 improves in many places over the previous version and Infiniti is taking big steps to get up to the top levels of luxury and performance.
* Test drove the BMW 335i, Acura TL & Lexus IS350 and none had it all wrapped in one beautiful pkg as the G37 did.The G37 is a best buy for the money.
* I needed something more luxurious so I test drove pretty much every thing including the bmw 335i, lexus is 350 and the winner the g37.
"
421,2008,mitsubishi,lancer,5.7,3.7,50,37,"* Oh and by the way, it looks great in black!Had a new 06 EX Civic with navi, and loved that car but went for test drive with my son, and fell in love with my new Lancer GTS, The lancer has everything a Techi Woman like me needs and craves.
* Handling is really fun in this car and the brakes are also really good.The Lancer met all expectations  (except no leather), great fuel economy, some of the highest emission standards, great handling, especially for New England roads.This is a fully juiced GTS!
* Okay there is the DE Lancer the ES Lancer and the GTS, I own the GTS and I just don't see the point, because it looks just like the others.
* Oh well, got to compromise a little unless price is no issue for you.Going from my 2000 Eclipse GT to this car was a big difference, especially the power and acceleration, I am satisfied with everything but the power, I wish they offered a larger engine or gave the 2.0 a smaller version turbo compared to the EVOs, but other than that, as stated, I am satisfied with this car... for now.I wasn't looking for a new car, but a deer convinced me to look for a new one!

422,2008,dodge,ram_pickup_3500,3.3,3.4,9,18,"* Improve fuel economy.I haul drilling equipment the first 10k miles my truck was in the shop about 16 to 18 times same problem all the time check motor light running out of fuel to the motor under load I got tired of it Dodge offered to give me back $30,000 of the $50,000 I paid for the truck well that was bull, a friend of mine told me of a old diesel mechanic that had a fix for it so I went to see him i left my truck there for the day he told me I would have no warranty but I feel like I have no warranty any how when I came back he had a pile of junk on the floor that looked like cats tubing and hoses and he went in to my dash and killed the red light I now have 32k miles no problems and 23 mpg on the highway its fixedI have only had my 6.7 diesel for a week but it has been back to the shop 4 times having fuel problems the motor light stays on on the dash and it feels like some one turns the gas valve off going up steep grades for about 2 seconds and then turns it back on I am going to give them one more try to fix it then they are going to get the truck back because I am getting tired of all this so far the best mileage I have got was 12 mpg empty with no trailer but that may be because of the problem that I am having it hard to tell hope they fix it this timeThe whole idea behind having a diesel is that you get reasonable gas mileage while towing things.
* I do a lot of heavy hauling 40 ft float with oilfield tools i cannot say how awesome the 5.9 liter 6 speed manual truck is it was in my opinion the best truck yet this new one seems to have a dead spot in the tranny foot goes to the floor sometimes without a downshift until its slows down 25 mph and it says it has more hp than the 5.9 but the tranny drags it down hard I own a 5.9 auto 05 and work truck is a 6.7 auto 07 I lined them up side by side and the 5.9 ran away from me same thing happened with a trailer even my mpg went down with the 6.7 i was getting 23 mpg hwy with the 5.9 and about 17 with 6.7 with almost 40,000 miles on it my word of advice find a 5.9 liter used with a manual trannyWe just got our truck last month and we love it.
* Ride a little stiff - it's a heavy duty truck so I expect that.Had a 2003 2500 SLT 5.9 turbo diesel 21 mpg and went with the 2500 Laramie 6.7 diesel 16 mpg not to good for a diesel, be nice to have the shifter button on the steering wheel also with the exhaust brake.
* Wake up Dodge!We purchased this vehicle in Feb, 3 days after we bought it we were having to be towed, a hose broke and all the antifreeze ran out, got that repaired, check engine light came on, took in wire harness had to be replaced, 2 weeks later check engine light came on again, they had clean the EGR vlv and EGR Cooler, replace the particulate filter and do a mobile sute cleaning.
"
423,2008,toyota,rav4,6.8,3.6,75,35,"* Our first choice was the Limited addition but chose the sport because of the darker seats and dash.Pros: lots of power  fun to drive  shiftronic transmission  roomy interior  excellent AC  great JBL stereo-the bluetooth feature is excellent  very good gas mileage so far  good quality leather interior.
* It is very quick with the V6 engine, and gets great gas mileage (25 mpg) for a 4wd, V6, SUV.
* Gas mileage is disappointing at 21/24, power is fine with 4 cyl in flat areas like FL.There's a lot to like about this vehicle, and a few minor annoyances.
* I've driven the car down to Florida and to DC and had no problems got good gas mileage (26 MPG), I love the car and would recommend it to anyone looking for a small SUV.
"
424,2008,nissan,xterra,6.0,3.6,26,17,"* I've been extremely pleased with this Xterra, it's such a great all round vehicle, easy to drive and not a ginormous vehicle.
* It's my first SUV and my first RWD vehicle, but its dimensions are easy to acclimate to, and its handling, though still SUV- like, is quite confident.No question that the Xterra is fun to drive  it is rugged and has presence.
* I've only owned this vehicle for about a month, but it didn't take long to realize this is a great vehicle.
* I can't see anything wrong with the vehicle - I really like everything about it.The FJ Cruiser and the 4-door Rubicon are both excellent vehicles that also have serious off-road capabilities and a manual transmission ... but I've made the right choice for me.
"
425,2008,chrysler,sebring,5.8,3.3,37,27,"* Have had car about 14 months now.Extremely reliable and very fuel efficient.Hard top makes for very quiet convertible.Styling seems to attract scores of people who watch the top go up and down in awe.I've had a couple of Mercedes guys just fall in love with this car.Trunk opens up to massive area representitive of the late 60's early 70's cars when convertible top is up for space.The 18 inch wheels I have on the vehicle really grips the road and the ride is excellant.The paint,fit and finish is also excellant.This car gives me great pride when I take it anywhere as someone is bound to spark a conversation about the car and or lead into the hard top covertible they had in the fifties.I have read other reviews on the 2008 convertibles, but I did read where anyone was complaining about the water dripping into the car when you put the window down or open the door when it is raining.
* I love the navigation, and the 'jukebox' style radio - it's great to be able to burn all my CD's to the car's hard drive and not have to load CD's all the time.
* Everything else is great!I bought the Sebring about 2 weeks ago and love it i have 2500 miles on it kind of high for a 2008 but i drive long distances I recently had a 300C (2005)and it had 120,000 miles when I was done with it but I will probabley put more than that on this sebring.
* Do yourself a favor and drive the Sebring and compare it to similar cars and I will be surprised if you don't buy the Sebring.I've had my Sebring convertible a year now, and my wife's had hers eleven months.
"
426,2008,toyota,tundra,5.4,3.6,68,59,"* Have just towed a loaded 5 x 8 trailer and a full bed (appx 5000 lbs total) that trip alone was 1300 miles avg gas was 15.6 - bottom line this vehicle has loads of room, features, and therefore offers me 4 vehicles in one, van like space & hauling, SUV like passenger room, great gas and truck like towing.
* Having owned all of the big three trucks and an older Toyota Tundra, I will say that the new 08 Tundra is the best truck I have ever owned.
* Better gas mileage than dodge but could be better (what can you expect for a truck).I have owned chevy, dodge, gmc, and ford pickup trucks, and I'm here to tell everyone that my new tundra is the best truck I have ever drove in my 40 years of driving.
* Granted, everyone is entitled to his/her opinion but I just don't feel anything comes close to the Tundra... Bluetooth, nav, rear window and sunroof, huge backseat, rear DVD, aux jack for your iPod or MP3 player, heated seats, rear backup camera, huge towing power, silky yet powerful brakes, quick off the line (although it'll swallow your gas) and real ""torquey"" feel.
"
427,2008,mazda,cx-7,5.1,3.7,36,34,"* Fun to drive and interior comforts that you wouldn't expect at the price point.I test drove almost all SUV in this segment, Honda CR-V, Toyota Rav4, Nissan Murano, Arura RDX, Lexus 350, Infiniti FX-35 and found this SUV the most attractive one for the money that I paid, this suv is fun to drive with lot of style.
* Fuel mileage is OK if you don't step on it too much but that's difficult because it's really fun to drive!Coming from a Saab sport Combi-Wagon I remain mightly impressed with the overall performance.
* Gas mileage stinks, don't let the dealership lie about the fuel, you HAVE to use premium gas or it lugs and shifts like crap.One of the best vehicles I've owned in oner 50 years of driving.
* The lows, much too noisy cabin, turbo lag, and eats tires every 20K.As I read my fellow CX-7 owner's reviews I get the feeling that many of us purchased this car more due to looks and the ability to boast about having a turbo charged vehicle than anything else.
"
428,2008,mercedes-benz,e-class,5.6,3.6,44,34,"* I began looking at Infiniti's, Lexus's, BMW's, and even Porsche's.

"
429,2008,hyundai,entourage,4.1,3.6,7,10,"* So far so good.only had the van for three weeks but love the way it handles and very surprize of the pick up this van has for it its size.to change the oil,the filter is on the top of the motor,I never saw that before.only had the van for three weeks but love the way it handles and very surprize of the pick up this van has for it its size.to change the oil,the filter is on the top of the motor,I never saw that before.
* If you can still find one, I bet you can get a great deal on this great minivan.I bought this vehicle in March of 2009 and in the first two weeks I noticed a discoloring in the headlight lens which I was told would not be replaced under the warranty and now I am sitting at two month mark and I am having problems with my driver's seat rocking and popping and now I am being told that yjis also will not be a warranty repair.
* I hope Hyundai is able to improve the gas mileage in the future.We purchased our 2008 Entourage a few weeks ago and love it!
* Fun to drive...trip computer rear sensors great features...I wish I would of upgraded to receive the power gate.
"
430,2008,honda,ridgeline,5.9,3.5,50,35,"* A solid frame and body construction can you say stronger than yours the avalanche doesn't compare I've driven both and that Honda is the better I've only got 300 mi on mine and I'm getting 14.7 mpg in town that beats out most trucks after the break in period I love the exterior looks and it is extremely comfortable I bought the bottom of the line to save $$$ how many trucks out there have all the engineering and safety features on the bottom trim level that they have on the top HondaMy husband and I always said, ""If Honda would just make a truck.""
* Don't pass up the Ridgeline because of looks, you will regret not test driving this vehicle when comparing the others trucks out there.This was my first time ever buying (leasing) a import vehicle and so far I have not been that impressed.
* I didn't think about the Ridgeline, I always said it was a woman's truck as well as it didn't look good.
* I is another superior vehicle which Honda always provides.I traded in my Ford truck and my Dodge Durango thinking I could get the best of both worlds with the Ridgeline.
"
431,2008,dodge,ram_pickup_2500,4.1,3.4,14,20,"* I am not a mechanic but how does the fuel get in the oilI have had nothing but trouble with the fuel system I contacted Dodge and they know of the problems but refuse to fix them I was told I could watch a dvd if I had any questions the problem arose with the blue tech after I bought the truck (with all blue techs) to fix it you have to dive 45 min for 45 mph w/o going under 45 mph and under 2000 rpm every week this with give you the truck terrible mpg and wear and tear on the truck for no reason I tell everyone I know do not buy Dodge because if something goes wrong it's your fault for buying their product if you don't have the time to waste 1 1/2 hours a weeks for no reason at all buy a Ford or Chevy look into it for yourself call any Dodge dealerI'm back with the second installment...
* I have know driven 20000+ miles w/ no engine light coming on... a little effort while driving & no issues... With a buddies truck, I demonstrated... Lug it - the check engine light comes on - don't lug, no issues... Keep the revs a little higher the exhaust brake on and it'll be as clean as a whistle... Keep on trucking...I like the power of my Hemi.
* The engine has power to spare and mileage on freeway at 65 is 21 - 22mpg with 100 miles on car...around town is not so good...12 - 15 mpg.I have the new 6.7-Liter Cummins turbo diesel engine equipped with the six speed automatic transmission.
* What I have learned after 3 trips to dealer - don't lug the engine, keep the rpm in the 1,800-2,200 range (easy to do with the thumb shift on the stalk), don't let it idle for long periods (why would you want to with current diesel prices), if you putt around town, periodically take it out on hwy and run it hard, use the engine brake, even when not towing (this also helps save your brake pads), no problems since I made these adjustments, hope this helps.
"
432,2008,nissan,armada,5.5,3.6,22,18,"* We LOVE our new Armada... rides great, tons of towing power, comfy, and lots of great technology.I bought the 2008 Armada and traded a 2005 Dodge Durango Limited.
* Our old van only got 16 in city and 21 on the hwy so there's not much difference in the fuel economy, and the power is awesome with the 5.6 liter V-8 engine.I bought this used with the intention to buy a new Chevy SUV, but after owning an Altima for 8 years and putting 175000 miles with no problems.
* I love the way it handles and I feel the safest I have ever felt when driving a vehicle.Just purchased my new Nissan Armada a little less than two months ago and I've already had it back at the dealership for service 4 times!
* Radio has great sensitivity and clarity (I like talk radio on AM), but Bose system severely lacks fidelity.Love the space, great improvement from the 04 ride, not as bumpy, a more plush drive.
"
433,2008,kia,optima,5.4,3.7,25,21,"* I understand that one week is not the same as owning, but I was that impressed with the car.A general perception with so many appealing ads on TV,people seem to be just convinced with brands like Toyota camry,Honda,Nissan.I have reviewed and test drived all of above but with their brand name,car seems too very expensive.Happened to try a Kia Optima and never had to give it a 2nd thought.With the price,safety features,mileage i rate this very much in par with Toyota honda nissan.Initially when i bought few asked me-Y did u go for a Kia,but whn i took them for a ride they had a different view altogether which made me so proud.classy sharp looks,smooth silent ride,responsive engine.
* Foreign is the only way to go.Well decided to try a KIA got my optima very base model only option ""floormatts"" so far I am impressed what you get as a base car,pwr windows, nice stereo w/cd player,pwr locks,a/c I just wish it had cruise control,I do not drive to much as I have a company car but I am in a new city and wanted a reliable car.I am suprised how peppy the car is and how the fit and finish seems above average.I expect this to be a great car excellent warranty I will be taking a 1000 mi trip soon and fully expect it will be a pleasure and very comfortable drive, I only have 195 mi on the car as of now BUT I expect to have the car for a long time to come and will report back.
* Easy for older person to get in and out, the mileage is on real, getting on a average city and highway 38 mostly city I have been a gm person all my life but they wouldn't bring prices down to match Kia and Kia gives you more options inside and out.I traded in my truck because of gas prices.
* If the exterior styling isn't first and foremost in your mind, then for quality ride and transportation, I would highly recommend the Kia Optima.
"
434,2008,ford,focus,6.0,3.7,115,77,"* Car is great but it is eating up the tires.Little red jewel  leather seating  love it  32 to 39 MPG never below 32  I'm 6 ft 300lbs  it rides great  been on 5 1000 mile trips  2500 miles a week to work and back  lots of room for me the wife and our poodle  second set of tires no problems at all  better than Honda or Toyota's we have had  drive one before decide on a small car  did I mention it has more leg room than any other small car we looked at, and that is pretty much all of them...I owned a 2001 Ford Focus ZX4 and was so impressed, I bought another one.
* My business partner bought a Toyota Yaris as it gets 37-39 but on highway speeds the road noise is terrible and the stearing is by wire so it does not handle near as nice as the focus, and is very slow to get up and going compared to the focus, 1.5 vs. 2.0. for just a couple of mpg I will take the power any dayMy 2008 SES ford Focus is the best.
* I miss the garage door opener in the visor & the automatic temp control, otherwise great care.I like this car, great gas mileage, fun to drive, basic but really nice interior.
* I have always owned Ford products, but after today and Ford's response to my lemon, I will not own another Ford once I can get rid of this one.I love my Focus.
"
435,2008,bmw,x6,3.1,3.4,4,9,"* Space is very good at 6'4"" no problem in finding a very comfortable seating position, even the back seats are good for a 6' person.
* As much as I loved the X5, I still missed the ""coupe"" look and feel.
* I ordered mine to have exactly what I wanted and the 3 weeks it took before I got the car seemed like and eternity!Very happy with the X6 after almost 2 months.
* You just have to push it a little harder.I just trade in the 2006 530Xi wagon, love this vehicle, fun to drive, have the SUV high command feeling, but with good road performance.
"
436,2008,volkswagen,jetta,6.4,3.6,85,48,"* I Bought this car for my wife (her 3rd Jetta) and I've been driving it since the very first day, I have a 2002 BMW 530i Myself and told my wife she can keep it until I get bored of driving the Jetta ...It has been 3 months and I'm still driving the Jetta and I think I will never get bored of driving it.
* For the price of the vehicle this is pretty hard to beat.I love my VW jetta its fun to drive handles like its on rails and runs like a cat especially when we go driving in the mountainsHave had this car for about a year now and really like it.
* I just traded in my '99 Passat GLX for this new Jetta and although I miss the interior size and weight of the Passat, the Jetta has come along way from feeling like your kid sister's car.
* If you're looking for an affordable car that performs across all categories you can stop looking, the 2008 Jetta is it.This is my 2nd Jetta, previously driving a '00 Jetta GL 5speed.
"
437,2008,honda,element,6.6,3.5,41,21,"* which is pretty good :) The bad thing we don't like is whenever we try to backup the vehicle is very hard to see if anything is behind us, because the rear seats are actually little higher than the front seats and it block the way of your rear view :(My sweet toaster is the best car I have ever owned and believe me I have owned a lot of cars (i.e.
* If i had to change a few things it would be to have the sunroof up front and have more storage space... thats it.All in all I really love the car and would definitely lease or purchase one!This car is really fun to drive but I do recommend the manual transmission.
* It's not a car so it's not fair to expect great gas mileage but for an SUV it's good.Thanks to Edmunds, I chose the Honda Element!
* we had a Toyota RAV4 prior , and now we bought it because of the leg room in the back seats is huge + it had high view for the both front seats + fold-up rear seats to make the cargo room bigger + also love the suspension.
"
438,2008,infiniti,qx56,5.9,3.6,19,13,"* In addition to the roughness on the road, I was also surprised by the engine noise/vibration under driver's seat while accelerating  I suppose that's due to the huge engine size.I just turned in my 04 Armada, got the 08 QX56, looking forward to a great sound system with all my music on the hardrive.
* I searched for the roomiest third row seat, roomy 2nd row seat and all the gadget that I experienced in driving all competitors in the same categories I found that QX56 has it all.This is a great vehicle for the price.
* Great truck, features I still haven't used in 10 months of ownership.I compared every SUV out there with a third row and this one gives you the most luxuries/technology for your dollar.
* From last year, they added a heated steering wheel, automatic fold down third row (folds flat), 10 GB hard drive, compact flash drive, aux jack for iPods, MP3 players, etc., and bigger 20"" wheels.
"
439,2008,lexus,is_350,3.8,3.5,9,15,"* Excellent Audio.I just bought a 2008 loaded Lexus IS350 w/7,000 miles...this is my 5th Lexus, the others being SUV's, but have also owned 3 BMW's, including a wonderful M3.
* If I drove major ""twisties"" everyday, maybe I would have bought another BMW, but few of us have the ""true"" abilities to push either Lexus or BMW to their honest limits...
* To love a car is to love the detail, and detail is one thing Lexus pays attention to in every car.My last car was a 2001 BMW 330.
* It is a really fun car to own and drive!Let me start by saying I test drove many cars before selecting the Lexus IS 350 (C350, 335i, G35, G37, CTS).
"
440,2008,scion,xd,6.6,3.9,99,50,"* A 2 red Xd we feel really young again and are having a blast Highly recommend the Xd to drivers that want to feel fun again.We love all the options that come standard, We Rate the scion XD 100 out of 100.My new 2008 scion hatchback is anything but boring.
* This is a great car and with this kind of gas mileage it will be a great car no matter what the gas prices become.I bought the Scion xD after driving the xA from an ebay sale, downsizing from a pickup truck which i can no longer afford to drive.
* I also drove the Fit Sport, and the xD feels like a much more substantial car and has much better pick-up on the road.It was between the Scion xD and the Honda Fit.
* The standard 160-watt Pioneer stereo system with 6 speakers sounds great.The Scion xD offers the little intangibles that you just cannot find in any car in its class.You can't go wrong with the Scion xD.I LOVE my new peppy xD!
"
441,2008,honda,civic,5.4,3.5,235,202,"* Very happy with my SI.I love my new Civic because you can chill with it and get great gas mileage or you can give it hell and still get pretty good gas mileage, and it is fun to hit the gas.
* Can't comment on mpg, haven't drove it or had it long enough to knowHaving owned a 2006 Honda Civic LX and traded that to an Accord with gas prices going nowhere but up I decided to go back to the Civic but with the upgraded EX version.
* About as fun as it can get for 28k which is a bit steep for any civic but i know the resale will be great go ahead buy one you will love it addictiveI only have 300 miles on my new Civic Hybrid, and I love it.
* I got just what I wanted with and my Civic reminds me of driving my old Acura Integra!After having over 13 new cars this is my first Honda and I really enjoy this car, I really don't know why I did not get one before It would have saved me thousands of dollars.
"
442,2008,pontiac,g6,7.5,3.5,60,20,"* I highly recommend this carI just bought my g6 this past Saturday so far so good, it has a smooth drive nice simple basic interior the chrome makes that basic interior look good i can fit my two car seats in the back with room for one person to fit (skinny) the trunk looks small but my massage table fits in the trunk perfect.The seats are comfy and I like how it tells me how much mileage I'm getting from a full tank on the radio.By far, G6 hardtop convertible is the best value in this segment.
* Avoid the g6 at all costs!I was recently in a car accident that wrecked my car but i got it fixed for my son as a first car i had a Ford (fix or repair daily) Taurus (that was garbage) so I went on a look for a new car and i bought a one year old at the time 2003 Pontiac Grand Prix GT and fell in love with GM so when i other car was being fixed I got a rental that was never driven before and it was a 2008 Pontiac G6 almost loaded and i bought one 2 months ago because it was the greatest car i have driven (and my son need his car) I am currently leasing me 4 door G6 and I absolutely love it!
* Only flaw-the instrument panel gauges do not have illumination during the day, great at night!Good car excellent drive response, fully loaded, leather, power seats, heated seat and instrumental panel well designedI bought this car about 2 weeks ago, I find that I made a great choice, and I'm loving every minute of driving in it!.
* Mazda was too small, Chrysler was not good, the Eos is worth a look but to get one with all the great features the G6 has would require spending about 3K more.
"
443,2008,ford,taurus,4.8,3.7,36,39,"* The '08 Taurus is a winner!I just purchased a new Ford Taurus Limited AWD, and never thought I would own a Ford since my Pinto back in the 70s.
* Good Job Ford!I test drove the new Taurus on a whim one Saturday and loved it so much I bought it on the spot.
* Highway mileage is best at 60- upper 20's, city is not great, but this is a 2 ton plus car (4075 with AWD loaded -C&D article) with 263 horsepower, larger than any Toyota or Honda by 400-500 pounds with AWD, so gas mileage for its size is commendable.
* Most of my co- workers drive BMW and Mercedes and would rather have my car after looking at it.I just bought a 08 Ford Taurus last week and can't believe what you get for the money.
"
444,2008,subaru,forester,7.2,3.7,21,8,"* Good road visibility, nice sterio system, love the handling, smooth ride eats up the bumps, heated front seats are very comfortable, smoothest shifting manual transmission I've ever driven.I was a little iffy about committing to always having to shift but now have no regretI never considered a Subaru until looking at all the others and not finding what I wanted.
* Interior is also roomier than expected, back seat is roomy enough if the front seats aren't pushed all the way back but even if they are I feel I have just enough legroom with front seats at maximum travel.
* Great performance and power when you need it while it's tame looks might suggest otherwise.I have 500 miles on my new Forester, so far I love it!
* I really don't know why I didn't look at Subaru earlier in life.I really like the premium package.
"
445,2008,nissan,maxima,4.9,3.6,23,24,"* I then went on to own a '92 Maxima, '98 Maxima, '03 Infiniti I35 (Maxima in disguise) and now this 2008 Maxima.
* I will have this maxima for a long time I finally got the loaded one.I must say that I wasn't looking to purchase a Maxima but when I found I could get a similarly equipped Maxima for almost the same price as an Altima I was intrigued.
* Nissan will NEVER get my business again.I traded a Nissan Quest for the Maxima in the fall of 2007 and I couldn't be happier!
* If Honda could build (my second car is a 2005 Honda) a super quiet ride, why can't Nissan?After shopping hard for 3 weeks for a mid size car, I bought the SE Maxima.
"
446,2008,pontiac,g8,5.0,3.5,52,52,"* It would be nice if they would make a less expensive, stripped down coupe version of the G8 that could fill the void where the firebird used to be, the solstice just doesn't cut it with no v8 and being so small a 5th grader can barely get in itI replaced my 2005 Ford Mustang with the G8 GT.
* After owning and driving this car for three month's, I realize, I have made a great purchase and I am not looking back!I have had my G8 GT for almost w months know and the more I drive it the more I love it.
* You can spend twice the money and get something like and buy a 5 series BMW, or you can buy the G8 GT get the same performance and have lots of money left over to bay the person at the gas pump.
* Buy one and have some fun, you know you want to.This car is a winner, I got it for my wife because she wanted a sports car and I couldn't afford the vette, and she can't drive a stick, so it was this, the black gt, she can't stop driving it long enough for me to go somewhere in it.
"
447,2008,hyundai,tucson,5.7,3.6,12,9,"* Great heat and A?C but is hard to hear radio over it--not strong speakersAs much legroom as a Ford Explorer but much better fuel economy...Purchased this SUV after having a 4 cyl 5 speed Sante Fe for 4 years & was quite happy with both service & reliability with Hyundai vehicles.
* This SUV is roomy (can hold her everyday wheelchair in the back or two medium dog crates w/o putting the rear seat down), is great fun to drive, and the turning radius is good (better than Mazda MPV, about the same as a Camry, not as good as a Volvo or BMW sedan).
* I have heard complaints about the mileage, but my only problem I have with that is, I want to drive mine everywhere, even if I have no where to go, because it is very nice to drive so if i am using more gas it is because I am driving more.I absolutely love the way my new SUV handles.
* I was considering a small car, like a Yaris for fuel economy, but when I actually took these little cars for a test drive, the novelty soon wore off!
"
448,2008,bmw,m3,7.1,3.4,12,5,"* The M3 is the best all around car on the market.I have always wanted a M3 and with the introduction of the new M in 08' I couldn't have picked a better time to get one.
* So the new M3 Cab is the best possible combination of fun, diversity and quality of driving I have ever seen.Drove a 2009 Porsche 911 with A/M before I drove the M3 6spd.
* Have had many AMG models, this M is probably best handling and driving enjoyment.I owned E46 E36 E30 M3s and this is by far the quickest and best M3.
* The M3 is a perfect solution for me and my family... we love it!I've had an E36 M3 & '00 M5.
"
449,2008,saturn,vue_hybrid,5.9,3.5,10,7,"* Maybe it's because it's a Mild Hybrid and GM never got to the full hybrid or plug in as expected.
* I drove a Tribute AWD for almost 5 years, and liked it, but the Vue is much better!Purchased for wife after typically driving more expensive vehicles (BMW's) and never setting foot in a Saturn dealership.
* Average 28 MPG city and 33 highway with a modest driving style.I keep tire pressure at 40 and get better mileage.
* Granted i drive a little fast and due to new locale often in a city mpg mode but even on long highway trips still avg the same mileage - just not worth it.
"
450,2008,honda,pilot,5.7,3.5,39,29,"* Great car and love the Honda's reliability.Gas mileage on the 2wd seems much better than my 2004.
* This is one of the best cars on the market and their price hasn't changed much since I bought mine previous one on 04.We've had our Honda Pilot for one month and love it!
* Overall the car is good, great visibility, comfortable on long trips, Gas mileage is good compared to other same size SUVs.
* Now I am not sure if the car is less reliable in general than I expected or if it just had this one thing.Got my 08 pilot and thought I was going to love it like all of the other Honda products I bought in past years.
"
451,2008,chrysler,300,4.5,3.3,14,17,"* I would have rather had a hemi and sport suspension!I own a Mercedes S430 that I drive as a personal vehicle and purchased the 300 Hemi, AWD as my company car.
* Still, my car looks and drives like a MUCH more expensive auto  gets good gas mileage with this smaller engine and has been trouble free.Had an '96 Avalon & needed new car.
* Hemi power is as advertised-IMO, much better than the GM 4.6l northstar, or any of the high output V6's.
* It's tough to complain about the 2.7L when it delivers gas mileage in the mid to high 20's.
"
452,2008,volvo,s40,7.4,3.8,14,5,"* This Volvo S40 is really fun to drive.I have only had it for a couple of weeks so I can not say much about the reliability, but the overall look and feel of the Volvo S40 is everything I was looking for.
* My Volvo S40 T5 AWD is my first Volvo.
* Fast.Just finished one year with my S40 awd and I can say for the first time in a LONG time I really LOVE my car and feal I got a great deal as well.
* I believe this is the new luxury car.Unless your family is morbidly obese, the small foot-printed yet comfortable Volvo S40 is perfect the vehicle.
"
453,2008,acura,rdx,6.5,3.6,43,23,"* Sure this vehicle is ""fun to drive"" and handles like a dream, and the interior is full of nifty features, like bluetooth, the Nav system and the phenomenal sound system.
* After a wise car salesman convinced me that I could get a 2008 RDX for the price of a used MDX with nearly 30-50 thousand miles it was no surprised I rushed to take the RDX for a test drive.
* The trick is to stay out of boost and under 70MPH on the highway, sure it takes patience but I've gone from 260 miles per tank to just under 400... that's a savings of about $150 per month based on the 1800 miles per month I drive.Checked out the Nissan Murano and BMW X3...Saved about $5k in regards to the Murano and $10k in regards to the X3 by opting for the RDX.
* It is a awesome combo or class, features, acceleration and I love the ELS system with 10 speakers making it better sounding than any other vehicle I tried.The RDX was the last car we looked at before we were going to commit to an BMW X3.
"
454,2008,mazda,mazda3,6.3,3.7,102,61,"* I sacrificed a little gas mileage between the Matrix 1.8L 4 speed and the Mazda 2.3L 5 speed but I ended up with a car that's a lot more fun to drive.I was looking for a new car for a long time that had good gas mileage and didnt use super unleaded gas.
* Doors solid.I love my Mazda3 Hatchback, Great gas mileage fun to drive no complaints at all if havent driven one do so and if your serious about buying new car give it a chance they really give you a lot of car for your dollar This car is great, the underpinnings are derived from a Volvo s40.
* I've started sharing the commute load between all 3 of my cars so the Mazda3 is in my driveway for yearsThe Mazda3 5-speed hatch is a great car to drive -- good handling and driving dynamics.
* In my mid forty's but I feels like a kid again when i get in this car.I love love love my Mazda 3.
"
455,2008,volvo,xc70,5.0,3.8,12,12,"* I average 18 mpg under mixed driving conditions (22 mpg higway) using a responsible ""kids in the car"" driving style and 89 octane gas.We've had Volvo sedans before, put this is our first wagon.
* It's my wife's daily driver and she appreciates the tank like solidity and the overall sense of quality it exudes.
* Having other Volvo's I appreciate the new design: smaller exterior size but larger interior space.
* Just upgraded my 08 XC70 with a new 08 XC70.
"
456,2009,honda,cr-v,6.5,3.5,74,40,"* I regret not going to test drive the RAV4.I've had SUV'S now for 20 yrs and last year, because of the gas spike, I traded for a Honda Accord...Beautiful car, but was not good in the snow...I kept checking out the Honda CRV's and finally traded last week...This car is ME!
* Love it even more than my Toyota Highlander, which was a 6 cylinder engine...I was apprehensive at first, because it was a 4cyl, but I see very little difference between the Highlander and my CRV...This car is a keeper, especially with the long New England winters...I really feel safe too, which was one of the determining factors, other than 4 wheel drive...Ok, maybe a nicer rearview mirror and a pop up trunk switch, a bigger fuel tank, but I'm not complaining!We love this car.
* I feel safe and secure - it's a sound vehicle, comfortable, quiet, plenty of energy for a 4 cylinder, easy steering, decent radio, love the adjustable height in driver's seat, plus adjustable steering wheel.
* I have absolutely no regrets in switching to the CRV - the interior is nicer, much more comfortable, the ride is much smoother, the stereo is better, driving position is amazing (I am tall and have a stiff back), and it's great for flopping the seats down and throwing things in.
"
457,2009,volvo,c70,6.9,3.8,11,5,"* Like 2 cars in one- coupe and convertible- Beautiful looking- great interior-very comfortable- fun to drive- people stop to watch the top go up and down- No problems in over a year- and best of all it gets the highest safety ratings unlike BMW which I eliminated because of its safety ratings- Love theVolvoAs a life-long Honda lover this is my first Volvo.
* The car looks great with the top up and fantastic with the top down.
* The safety features that Volvo has included along with that smooth ride makes you feel safe and secure even with the top down.
* Love the top fold- down, and the trunk space for a convertible.
"
458,2009,mazda,mx-5_miata,5.7,3.7,8,6,"* It drives like a dream, it's fun to watch people look at the car and smile, it's fun to take corners at high speed, it's fun to listen to the great stereo with the top down and the wind in your hair while singing at the top of your voice.
* It was great fun to drive, when it would start and it wasn't raining, but living in Baton Rouge that wasn't often.
* To be succinct: I love this car!I recently purchased a 2009 MX5 Grand Touring PRHT with the optional suspension & premium package, and I love it.The top goes down in 12 seconds and the 6M with limited slip differential makes it a true driver sports car.When it comes to interior it stands alone in its class,the exterior has 20 years of evolution making it one of the best looking roadsters on the road.
* Test drive one - you will love it!I drove an '09 on a whim, didn't think I'd buy as I loved my 07 Grand Touring PRHT.
"
459,2009,toyota,tacoma,5.5,3.6,41,34,"* Truck runs great, very tight, great power (much better than my V8 F-150) Truck is just the right size, fuel mileage much better.Just got a new V6 auto Access Cab 4x4.
* The standard tires and rims don't do much for the looks but ride great and are quiet.This could've been a great vehicle but the transmission ECM had to be reset and there is a torque rumble at 25mph.
* This is just one great truck, well built, and fun to drive.I owned 1989 Toyota pickup, 20 years later Toyota still out does it.
* Couldn't you do that Toyota?I bought the reg cab base with AC because I plan on owning this truck long after most power options would fail.
"
460,2009,audi,a4,6.5,3.6,60,32,"* Great.I am a 7-time BMW owner and was hesitant to compare the new Audi A4 to a 2009 BMW 3 series, but was surprisingly pleased with the build quality, performance, and amenities you get in the Premium Plus package and decided to go with a new 2009 A4 vs the BMW 328xi.
* This is my first experience with BlueTooth and its much better than OnStar.I just got the A4 AWD 2.0T AT White w/ Black interior Premium Plus with the custom OEM Audi Sport 18"" rims on all seasons and added the chrome tips.
* I've never really been excited about a vehicle until this car!I have owned various BMW's & Audi's over the past 15 years, and this seems to be one of my favorites.
* Except for power I actually like this car a lot more than my 550i.The new Audi A4 is perhaps the best of what Audi has produced.
"
461,2009,subaru,legacy,6.4,3.7,28,16,"* Other than that, buy one, change the oil every 7,500 miles and drive, drive, drive... Oh, and the gas mileage is great.
* Subaru was the only answer since we only purchase Subaru, Honda, and Toyota products and we wanted an AWD car.I have not yet recorded 900 miles on my '09 Legacy 2.5i Limited, and I am very happy with my decision.
* It's getting better gas mileage than I expected it would, which is an added bonus.I bought this car back in May of this year because I was looking to trade in my 2006 Chevy Equinox which I hated, so I saw an advertisement on tv for Subaru and decided to check it out.
* I don't understand the mileage rating from Subaru, I read other posts and several people have pointed out that these cars can get 32-36 mpg on the hwy.
"
462,2009,audi,a5,6.2,3.6,15,9,"* Being 1 of 3 in my area an S5 nothing to say about that, but the other A5 has the basic, if u can spend the money get the upgrades 19"", B&O system and as I'm reading the reviews the standard leather isn't good, I have the Milano and can't complain.
* If u like to be aggressive sometimes it's worth it, the car totally changes under you (Trans, Suspen, Handle) and I have to say, for the small HRS power I have knocked out some pretty beefed up cars when I hit that button.It's fun, the roof needs to open, I mean really for that much money Audi could do much better.
* It has enough power to make it fun to drive, and the Quattro all-wheel drive is fun to challenge in corners.For the money, one of the best cars I have owned.
* Looked at a number of cars in this segment but ultimately choose the A5 for the practicality of the AWD, decent MPG, and of course the stunning looks (don't buy this car if you don't like being gawked at).
"
463,2009,suzuki,sx4,4.1,3.5,7,10,"* The car is great fun to drive and a rare small crossover model that is actually comfortable with great seats and dash layout.
* If it does well for a while, we plan to return for a Suzuki purchase for our other vehicle...the Equator truck to replace a Durango.I've had the 2009 Suzuki SX4 Crossover for less than a month now.
* !Had this car for three months and I cant wait for the winter months to see how it handles in the snow!..A great, fun to drive little vehicle.
* From the 34 mpg I just averaged on a trip to CA last week, to the great navigation system, the heated seats, the panoramic view, the spacious trunk space, the back seats that comfortably seat a 170 lb.
"
464,2009,toyota,prius,5.0,3.6,22,22,"* I was driving a stick shift before so it really is different.This car is cool because: 1) the gas mileage is great, 2) the driving experience tells you that the car uses newer and better technology (for example driving away without the gas engine running and having the gas engine shut down at red lights), 3) the display lets you know how the advanced systems are powering the car and how much kinetic energy has been captured and stored in the battery to power the car later, 4) even with all the gas saving features the car is large enough to be practical for a small family.Might want to look elsewhere if over 6ft tall as I am.
* In the 3 months I've been driving it I average 62 mpg city/53 mpg highway/58 mpg combined (well above the combined 47 mpg EPA rating).
* I have nearly 6,000 miles on my Prius so far and have not yet been able to break the 41 MPG average, despite an 80 mile per day commute - this is disappointing as the sole reason for purchasing the Prius was to gain maximum fuel efficiency.
* Quality is cheap...metal dents easily, interior is cheaply done, little storage room and I am single with one medium sized dog and one little dog...Selling this to buy used low mileage Subaru Impreza...(regret purchase and will not buy another Toyota...they make them too CHEAP now.
"
465,2009,chevrolet,malibu,5.5,3.6,67,54,"* Wanted a sedan and really like GM design Came down to saturn aura, pontiac g6 and malibu, I never owned a chevy but when i drove one i was hooked.The price i got it for was great I have owned maybe 20 new cars but for some reason this one really excites me!!
* Vs. the new Camry - While I like the Camry's exterior design better, I would give both cars equal rating for the interior  however you can't beat the Malibu's overall value.
* For very frugal people like us, we definitely recommend the Chevy Malibu, very classy and safe car for less money.I owned a 2001 Chevy Malibu before this, got it used & absolutely hated it.
* The Malibu feels more like a luxury car than a family sedan.Great on gas, quiet, great looking, handles like a dream.
"
466,2009,mercedes-benz,e-class,5.6,3.6,20,16,"* Since I had no problems with my 08, the 09 is just icing on the cake.I've owned S class and E and CL class Mercedes over the years, including a 2008 E Class Sport and this new 2009 E Class Sport.
* Since I had no problems with my 08, the 09 is just icing on the cake.I've owned S class and E and CL class Mercedes over the years, including a 2008 E Class Sport and this new 2009 E Class Sport.
* Six months of ownership, and 3 problems, 2 trips to the shop, 1 tow, 1 battery recharge...and worse of all, tons of aggravation and frustration dealing with Mercedes Benz.Addressing the vinyl vs leather for such expensive vehicles, please note that Mercedes has a long history of offering the best vinyl seating ever made, which is better than most cars leather.

"
467,2009,nissan,cube,4.9,3.6,28,29,"* I love this rounded cube!Absolutely the most amazing Retro""Mini Van"" this 50 yr old has ever driven with special thks to Cash4clunkers..Added all the toys to my Black SL..Gnormous,SL Preferred,Int Designer Packages,Rear cargo, 16""Alloys-Grey..Head turner at every corner,very comfortable to sit in and drive,handles corners with ease,tons of space, eager to leave them at the green light.Currently we have 3 trucks incl Element EX and Grand Caravan.Considered and researched Kia Soul,ScionXb Prirus,Element SC...One drive in the CUBE and I was sold..All the bells and whistles disco lights,shag rug Incredible stereo with all controls on steering wheel,feels like I'm driving an Infinity/Lexus.. A must have for any AARP'r!I have had this car for 2 weeks and put 1400 miles on it.
* [Unless there is a wind storm]I also meet a lot of new people with this car's curious looks.I have purchased the cube about 4 weeks ago one drive is all it took.
* it is a great ride and drive very comfortable for mid size people great power- I have spent months reviewing cars like Mercedes, Cadillac, Element, Prius.
* The fun part...it's a blast to drive!All in all a very good first effort the interior layout is nice and very roomy I'm 6'2 400 pounds and it felt o.k.
"
468,2009,acura,tl,6.5,3.6,70,37,"* But out of all the cars I have owned, this the best so far.After test driving 3 different 2009 TLs w/Tech while my 2007 TL was in the shop I found it was improved in many areas but took a few steps backwards that would keep me from trading my 2007 TL for a new 2009 TL - not worth the price difference.
* The G37 was great to drive but has unimpressive interior and feels small , the ES350 is very comfortable to ride but un- sporty to drive and large, the TL has amazing interior, advanced technology package, fun to drive and but ugly grill (beak).
* I looked at the Lexus RX350 and was sure I was going to buy that but Lexus will not discount the price, so I test drove the TL and bought it the same day.Okay...At first I didn't like the styling of the new TL.
* I owned a TL from the previous generation and this new version improves on everything that I didn't like about the old version and the SH-AWD makes it into the car I always wanted.Having driven many competitive vehicles (bmw, lexus, audi, cadillac, infiniti, etc), the value of the 2009 TL is simply in a class of its own.
"
469,2009,hyundai,genesis,5.1,3.6,93,88,"* I give it an A.Believe it or not I once believed that Hyundai was an inferior brand, after buying my Genesis And driving the car for the last week I must say that anyone in the large performance Luxury Market would be foolish not to buy this car every aspect of this automobile screams Luxury From the twelve way power seat to the throaty almost three hundred Horsepower v-6 I have owned a diverse selection of luxury cars and I have to say I have never been more impressed with a vehicle.
* Throttle is a bit sluggy off the line, but punch it a little and she zooms up to speed with very smooth shifting and great tracking- sound system is superior, hand free phone at HWY speed sounds great to callers, this is a great car and a great value- time will tell if the abundance of plastic parts will hold up and I noticed that the rear wheel wells are lined with some type of fibrous cladding- hope it holds up well to Chicago winter- all in all, this has been a joy to drive, and I am constantly getting the thumbs up from other drivers- this car is becoming the hot ride of the season.I'm a jazz man and I love music.
* After test driving BMW, Acura, Lexus and others, Hyundai earned my business because the Genesis is every bit the car it is represented to be.
* Would strongly recommend a test drive to anyone who is looking for a very high level of comfort, features, and performance.very good all around car , nice exterior and interior I walked into the Hyundai showroom to see the Genesis in person as I had only seen it on tv.
"
470,2009,acura,rdx,3.8,3.6,12,20,"* The RDX is the best driving small SUV out, it's faster, handles better, and has fantastic steering - new editions like the Q5 will give it a run, but its price keep it from being shopped together.I just picked up my new RDX & I LOVE IT!
* I don't dog it on the Turbo but it's a comfort knowing it's there if I need it.I got my RDX tech for around 32k + taxes.
* No Audi interior, leather or BMW brakes or steering either, but not enough difference to justify $15KJust got my Acura RDX, overall I like the truck.
* What it is is a great 4WD SUV with luxury features and the best handling of any SUV I've driven.
"
471,2009,jeep,grand_cherokee,5.5,3.6,11,9,"* Seriously....This is a sick jeep...it amazes me in every way...i traded in a tahoe on ""22's...the power in the SRT is outstanding and fun to drive every day....I've had mine about 5 months and I've put 12,000 miles on it...I am reasonably satisfied with my new jeep.
* The current Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited Hemi (V8 package fully loaded) combines the finest in luxury, handling, and towing that I have found in any vehicle.
* The current Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited Hemi (V8 package fully loaded) combines the finest in luxury, handling, and towing that I have found in any vehicle.
* For a midsize suv I would recommend the 2009 Jeep Grand Cherokee over any midsize suv.Just bought the Overland version of the Cherokee with the Hemi.
"
472,2009,subaru,outback,5.9,3.7,26,18,"* This isn't uncommon!When we got so much ice in December of 2008 I got tired of not being able to get my truck out of the parking lot so I went to Walker's Subaru and got an Outback Legacy Wagon.
* I bought the new Outback because I got a great deal and I didn't look forward to 3k miles in the very uncomfortable '99 Outback driver seat.
* The Outback has been fantastic ever since, good power, acceptable gas mileage, nice handling, good utility, beautiful interior, just an overall solid package with the SE trim (very much worth it over base).
* I drive 100 miles a day and it get's better gas mileage as it breaks in.
"
473,2009,hyundai,azera,5.2,3.6,13,12,"* I purchase the Hyundai Azera Limited after having a Camry for only 15 months (which also was purchsed new) The Azera Ltd. has much more power with just scacrificeing a mile or two MPG.
* The suspension is not so great, is very stiff so if you don't like the feel of the road ""Do not purchase this car"" I can't wait to trade in for some other and remember I purchase this car not even 3 months ago.My '09 Azera Limited offers alot of bang for the buck.
* I am so ""sold"" on Hyundai now that I expect to move up to the very quiet Genesis with my next purchase.I was actually looking at the new Genesis, but financially the Azera was a better fit for me.
* I wasn't planning on buying right away but the value of price & luxury that the Azera offered was too tempting & I have not been disappointed at all after having the Azera for just a week.
"
474,2009,acura,tsx,5.3,3.6,83,74,"* It's an all around enjoyable car to drive and as much as I liked my TL, I like my TSX better.Test drove both the TL & TSX and the TSX is a lot more fun to drive so I bought it.
* Other interior differences are the premium sound, which - on the non-tech - is FAR superior to the rather dismal offering in my 2006 TSX, and includes a sub woofer for deep and thumping bass.I?ve been driving my 2009 TSX for a little over 4 weeks and have had an opportunity to compare in detail to my 2005 TSX, which I still own.
* The rest of us who go to work everyday, want to have a little fun and not pay a fortune in doing so will enjoy this carBought myself a TSX for my birthday, upgrading from a 98 VW that had lost its lust for life (as well as my love of driving), and I am astounded at how much I love to drive this car, and how others react to it.
* It's great for city driving because it's still a smaller sedan, but big enough where you don't get bullied on the road or feel unsafe if you were to get in an accident.
"
475,2009,dodge,caliber,9.2,3.4,23,2,"* This is the first ""small"" car that I have seen with midsize car seating room and comfort.We love the Caliber SXT.
* We love our Caliber!Great for transporting to art fairs large pictures, etc.
* It hit 111 yesterday, the AC works just great no problem at all keeping up with that heat on next to the lowest setting on the AC.All I can say about this car is that it has everything you need and more and for 2009 they have really cut down on wind and engine noise from 2007 and for 2010 they are getting a new interior.I'll say it right away... getting 33MPG and car is only two weeks old - 5 speed manual.
* It's fun to drive and has a great style.Well, what can I say.
"
476,2009,nissan,xterra,6.2,3.6,8,5,"* I was happy to see that Nissan has continued with their quality in workmanship and ""thinking of the little things"" like the door in the skid plate that allows you access to the oil filter when changing your oil.
* Reasons: I can see out of the X, the X doesn't need premium gas, the X has four doors, and the off road packages for both are the same.
* Mine came with the free technology package and I love it, the hands free bluetooth has been great and the rockford audio is quite enjoyable.
* On the road, if you like power, this is the suv for the money.Lots of power, handling is great, sits up high.

477,2009,audi,q5,5.7,3.6,27,20,"* The Audi Q5 does not handle like your normal SUV and it gives us better mileage so far in the City and on Highway driving with way more storage room than the Acura TSX and ability to haul more stuff.
* Thanks Audi!My brother needed a new ride and after test driving all competitors bought an Audi Q5 premium plus w/navigation.
* MMI is solid, cargo space may not be as large as some others but that was not a factor for me (don't have 22 kids and 3 dogs to shuttle around), gas mileage seems to be above listed, visibility is very good, steering responsive but not overly sensitive, braking is predictable, road noise is low even on 19s, and the most important factor is that it feels like a sedan and drives like one.I've had more fun driving this car than any car I have owned and I've had several sports cars.
* Although a very good looking car and fun to drive at high speeds, this car transmission technology is still too new and Audi has not full control over it, I have a default transmission, and am not the only one, they have no right answers as how to fix it, they first exchange the mechatronics which has nothing to do with the jerking of the transmission in the lower gears, and after trying different things and not being able to repair the car their best solution is to replace the entire transmission in a vehicle that has less than 2800 miles.
"
478,2009,subaru,tribeca,5.8,3.7,7,5,"* Fit & Finish, features, quality of workmanship, power/safety/great 4x4, Ipod connectivity, great seats, and best of all  it has Japanese quality control, but is assembled in Indiana.
* Nice, solid vehicle!After owning 3 Subarus since 1988, I bought Subaru's premium model-Tribeca Limited-7 Seats.
* I just leased a Honda for myself before I found this one....but I know now what my next car will be if they don't try to improve it!Just traded in my 06 B9 Tribeca and bought an 09.
* Subaru's improvement over the years shows in Tribeca-A gorgeous interior design/luxurious feel  sleek exterior lines  ample ground clearance/best AWD in the business  5-star crash ratings.
"
479,2009,toyota,matrix,5.1,3.6,40,39,"* 20 mile commute is comfortable and all-wheel drive adds to the handling, fuel tank could be larger, and rear blind spots need attention.Gets great gas mileage (avg 33 mpg in mixed driving), comfortable, easy to get in and out, plenty of power in the base model AT, but fit and finish is horrible, rattles in several places, exterior paint chips all over the front (I say paint is bubbling, dealer says road debris), if that's the case, the design is poor, it looks good, but the paint will be destroyed by simple everyday driving.
* I'd highly recommend the 2009 Matrix to anyone looking for a solid smaller car with great handling, good gas mileage and one that's fun to drive!After driving a Chrysler 300 for 2 years and filling gas up everyday I decided that I wanted a smaller car.
* I had a 2005 matrix - good little car, shouldn't have ever traded in.I recently came off a trip and the mileage I got with my Toyota Matrix was 40 mpg going and 41 mpg returning.
* The gas mileage is incredible (compared to my 01 Chevy Cavalier), It's very ""giddy"" in the speed department, Very maneuverable on the road and comfortable to drive...I was looking to downsize from my Tacoma since gas is so expensive and I went to look at Scions when the sport Matrix jumped out at me at the dealership.
"
480,2009,ford,fusion,7.1,3.7,52,21,"* You're in for a pleasant surprise.Mine is actually the SE model not the SEL, I liked the looks and handling of the Fusion, although it's a little rough on a bad road, also the price was right, it's such a shame that Ford has kept this underpowered engine for so long, it is so slow at take off and merging, I should have gotten the V6, otherwise a nice car and a good value.
* Our other car is due for replacement next year and we will be closely looking at another Fusion as well as the new Taurus.The quality of my 2009 Fusion has been extremely good so far.
* I got about 35 mpg on my trip and did have to refuel until I made it back home..awesome.. Driving this car is an experience.. just test drive one, you'll understand..oh yeah..I have the 5 speed manuel..so much fun to drive..I was looking at the Altima because it was firmer than the base Fusion, but drove a ""Sport Appearance Package"" car with the tire and suspension upgrade.
* my fusion has 2000 miles now and im loving the gas milage.26mpg town 35hwy.The ride is smooth and quiet.Could use a little more power on take off but cant complain with milage like that.Sound system is great!
"
481,2009,kia,borrego,7.0,3.7,16,7,"* Just got it a week ago so can't speak for reliability so far, but fun to drive...great quality vehicle at a low price..(KIA is giving $3,000.00 off right now) it's really a no brainer...almost bought a Honda Pilot but this is a much better vehicle at a much lower price.This is a great vehicle, really fun to drive on road or off.
* My only concern is that I have yet to see any other Borrego's on the road - I know they are out there somewhere, i'll just keep looking....I had been looking at small to mid-size SUV's for a few years and saw the Borrego in a car show.
* Bought the V8 engine and love it..read some complaints on the 6 cylinder and since I tow a boat I wanted the V8 with the 6 speed transmission...works great and almost the same mileage as the 6 cylinder engine...Its a real joy to drive and love the 100,000 mile 10 year power train warranty!!
* Was difficult to find the Limited 4x4 but found place in LA to buy and drove back to SF - was a great way to fully test the car and my initial feelings were confirmed - I love this car!Why pay 35K for a premium fuel pathfinder (that's a little smaller) when the safety doesn't even compare.
"
482,2009,toyota,highlander,7.4,3.6,31,11,"* The sticker stated 24 MPG on the highway and it doesn't come close.My 3rd Highlander Limited...each prior vehicle was driven 60,000 miles (Leased)...bought this one...in the first 2 months drove 8,500 miles exploring the country...average 23 MPG at 65-80 mph on Interstates...a real pleasure to drive...10 hour days on the road are very comfortable, especially with heated leather seats...smart key and power tailgate are slick...this one is a keeper!
* We plan on keeping this vehicle for many years to come.Go test drive them all, but you will come back to the Highlander if you want an easy to drive SUV with lots of power and feel on the road.
* The car feels great with a comfortable driver's seat and smooth, well controlled, powerful performance.
* Would have been my dream SUV but now I hate to drive it because it's bumpy like a old 1987 car that need new struts or something.
"
483,2009,honda,ridgeline,5.0,3.5,9,9,"* I couldn't be happier as this vehicle fulfills all my needs for a truck - adequate towing, people mover, great ride, good at the lumber yard/garden center - in a 4 wheel drive long lasting Honda package.
* Same towing capacity the same mileage, with a lot more comfort and class.I looked at the Tacoma, but didn't like the pricing (had to add a whole package just to get keyless entry, another package to get tow wiring, etc).
* Prior to purchasing the 09 Ridgeline I drove each competitors vehicle, and decided to purchase a 2009 Ridgeline RTL w/navigation.
* There are many small intelligent things: the heater doesn't blow cold air on you (it waits until the car has warmed up before blowing any air), the driver's window has auto-down AND auto-up, you can lower all four windows with the key fob (great for airing out hot air), and the car gives you your real-time mpg as you drive.
"
484,2009,chevrolet,corvette,6.7,3.6,10,5,"* 2006 fast not a lot of built quality, 2009 what a great car quiet as any car faster then most great gas mileage, The base Corvette is the best value on the sports car market, Nothing makes me happier than racing a Porsche costing 2x as much and getting 20+ miles to the gallon.
* It rides better and so much quieter that I can hear the radio at highway speed.This is the third Corvette and the best one I have owned.
* This car has a noticeable power increase vs my 99 and the cyber grey was a fantastic choiceTraded in my 2004 Corvette coupe on a new 2009 4LT Blade Silver Metallic coupe fully loaded with the exception of dual exhaust.
* Heard a lot of negative items about the car like road noise, steering, ect.. Nope, 125% satisfied with my Z06.I had a 2005 Coupe and had a lot of trouble with it, mostly electronic.
"
485,2009,saturn,vue_hybrid,6.7,3.5,8,4,"* Took to dealer service, they stated anything from 20-30 was ok, and that it could take up to 4K miles to break in the engine, bullony I read the whole manual and advised the service manager that per the manual it says if the car stands for 3 months it can cause major damage to the hybrid battery and, my car was sitting at the dealer lot for 8 months and only got 60 miles, so he agreed to replace it, we will see what happens, I hope this resolves the problem.
* waiting to see savings....Traded in my envoy to get this hybrid, and I am glad I did, getting 28 mpg around town, and over 32 on the highway, its pretty much a smooth, quiet ride, didn't really pay a premium for getting a hybrid, as Saturn was offering $3,000.00 off the msrp, in addition to other discounts.
* I like that even though this thing is a hybrid with low rolling resistance tires, GM still gave it sporty styling including sharp 17 inch alloy spoke wheels.
* I get 28 MPG with 90% city driving and 30+ MPG on the freeway.
"
486,2009,jeep,patriot,6.4,3.6,28,16,"* I got the Freedom Drive II and still get 22-25 MPG depending on driving habits - the car is roomy, the leather is great and the uConnect Navigation radio fantastic.
* With its 4x4, traction control, EBD, Hill decent control, & Electronic Roll Mitigation, you can be safe in any driving situation If you are looking for a small 4x4, take a test drive, compare it to CRVs, RAV4s & others  sure you will be sold on the Patriot.I have had My Patriot for 2 months now and have had no complaints.
* I would like to hear from other's that hit the gas a little, and have the Patriot with the cvt.We just picked up our new patriot 09 limited, sun and sound package on 8/5/09 and noticed our 1st leak (water pouring out of the front Dome Light) about 2 weeks later (1st rain storm).
* I love my 09 Jeep Patriot  it is a pleasure driving it  this is my first Jeep product and I'm very satisfied.
"
487,2009,acura,rl,5.0,3.6,7,7,"* Other brands more recognizable, but this is a better car.acura nails it with 09 rl  looks are great inside and out  have 05 rl, which has been excellent  09 looks better, drives more in control with road  drove m3  nice car, overpriced, not particularly in control of road  drove audi a6  tired look, overpriced when compared to all options built in to base rl  drove m 35  same old car, also not competitive price-wise if you load up the options to compare it with the rl  gas mpg is strong for awd  very hard to beat without spending at least $10,000 more on competitorsThis is one nice car!!
* I can't imagine how anyone could actually drive this against the Lexus GS, the Infiniti M, or the 5 series BMW and not buy the RL.
* Went to Acura to look at the 2009 MDX (for my wife), saw the RL on the floor and looked in the interior.
* Handles well with it's all wheel drive.Test drove the new Jag, Bmw 5 series, Infiniti M, Audi A6 & A5 and Lexus LS and GS.
"
488,2009,pontiac,g5,4.0,3.5,6,9,"* Just purchased the GT 2009, it's a fun car to drive, lots of leg room in front, and if there isn?t enough leg room in the back for other people, then they can take the bus, or consider themselves lucky to get a free ride.
* They just say ""there's nothing we can do"".I bought this car with a combination of rebates (regular & 'owner loyalty') plus GM doubled my GM Card fun bucks.
* So far, enjoying the creature comforts, sound system and the ""GREAT"" gas mileage - 39+ mpg!
* The car gets great mileage,very comfortable,xm radio in the lonely areas,fun to drive.
"
489,2009,hyundai,accent,6.2,3.6,15,9,"* What a car, this little Accent drives great, has head room for my cowboy hat, accessory holders, great radio/CD player, goes around curves like a BMW, less noise interior than my old caddy, drives by gas stations on trips, we love our light green color, air conditioning cold as ice, leg room for my 6'1"" 250 lbs and comfortable in drivers seat, Took my granddaughter to lunch and she had plenty of room in rear seat next to the groceries and half dropped back seat.
* So car let say is ok, worth money I gave, but I would do more improvements: 1) put smaller engine (1.4l) so they will beat Toyota in fuel efficiency 2) I do not really like in this car gear stick is not smooth and is hard to change gear, Hyundai schould work on this in manuals.We test drove several other popular cars and didn't expect the Accent to be the one we choose, but one test drive and we were sold.
* Had a very minor issue with a 'rattle', and the dealer took care of it quickly.I was looking for a another good car I had a Hyundai before and I loved it so I went back for another and iam glad I did the hatchback is wonderful and I love the way it drives it handles very good.
* I cant say enough about this little fun car, except I highly recommend this vehicle!I bought my Accent SE six weeks ago and have put 1900 miles on it since.
"
490,2009,mitsubishi,galant,5.2,3.7,11,10,"* I cant think of anything that I don't like about this car - very sporty looking starting with the grill to the tail lights they look like the Lexus tail lights.
* Low points include cheap plastic interior, VERY tight suspension system giving a bumpy (and noisy) ride, adjustable seat limitation set too high, rattling seat belt mechanism, over-sized tail lights, and the GPS DVD player in the trunk is set in a very poor location.
* The 2009 Sports Galant from Mitsubishi motors is a great sedan with a moderate price.
* The Galant gets me from A to B with good sound from the 140w system, decent pep when passing hwys, great safety features.The whole experience of the 2009 V6 sport is extraordinary!
"
491,2009,mazda,mazdaspeed_mazda3,6.0,3.7,9,6,"* I was already used to and liked the Mazda 3, but the speed 3 just makes you want to step on it every chance you get.
* I've also been getting pretty decent gas mileage in the mid 20s.Purchased my Speed 3 about 2 weeks ago and so far it has been a blast to drive.
* After mulling it over for about 2 months I took the plunge and traded my 2008 Mazda 3 5 door hatch for a 2009 Mazda speed 3.
* Love it, fit and finish and overall car is just great quality.. plenty of power to get me into trouble and will be a great DD and a good autox toy.
"
492,2009,hyundai,santa_fe,8.8,3.6,28,4,"* Seats average at best for comfort.I traded a BMW in 325I on this Hyundai / dollar for dollar/ i made the right choice being that i needed moor room / just changed to SYN oil this boosted the MPG to 26 HY/ put a drop in K&N ait filter, Drop in replacement of factory/ over all performance gained approx 15 HP/ with 26 + mpg with the kick down snap you want / and extra tow power /Rely like this Cross over / interior is well designed !
* I would recommend any of the new Hyundai because of the huge improvements done in these recent years.My wife fell in love with the Santa Fe a year ago.She never showed much interest in the many cards that we owned including Cadillacs and a Lexus (es 330 2004) The Santa Fe is as quiet as the Lexus.
* !After 6 months of research on SUV's, I chose the Santa Fe for it's style, performance, price, warranty program, leg and head room (I'm 6'-4"").
* Doing this, I got the limited model for slightly less than the SE retail price after rebates and the ""Cash for Clunkers"" deal.Shopped hard, drove the 2010 Equinox and Rav-4, wanted to buy American but the Santa Fe won out with the overall value.
"
493,2009,bmw,5_series,7.1,3.4,15,6,"* On top of all the attributes of a 5-series -- much more comfortable interior, quiet and luxurious ride but still that BMW feel and handling -- it gets better in-town gas mileage than the coupe.
* The 5 Series is just a joy to drive, puts a smile on my face every time I press that ""start"" button.Well it's been 4 years since I've owned a Beemer (02' 330i Conv.
* It took a little getting used to its ""heft"" compared with the 3 Series it replaced, but now that I'm used to that, and the operation of the iDrive, I really love the car.
* The handling and suspension, what can you say it's a BMW, I told myself I'd buy a Genesis or try something new, but for an enthusiast driver, THERE IS NO COMPARISON TO THE FEEL OF A BMW this car is soo tight.Previous owner of 325 and 328xi coupe.
"
494,2009,ford,escape,6.2,3.7,55,33,"* Leather is very comfortable, steering great, ride quiet, got the 17"" wheels, so handling is sports car like, shifts very smooth, so far I love the Escape.
* We have a 6 year old black lab so we get the dark interior and we love the way the rear seats fold flush to the back of the front seats - Max loves to lay with his head on the headrest between us so many other fold-down rear seats just didn't work for us.
* It's a very addictive machine - great job Ford!This is the first Ford vehicle I buy and I am very disappointed with the build quality.
* If I could offer one improvement to Ford it would be to move the back seat back and add some leg room.My first Ford was a 2004 Ford Focus ZX3, and I loved it!
"
495,2009,bmw,x6,5.4,3.4,7,6,"* I've got utility when I need it with plenty of cargo room for a weekend ski trip, no kids yet to worry about messing up my nappa leather, physics defying handling for an SUV that must be experienced to be believed, a peppy engine that begs to be put in sport mode and thrashed, BMW quality/service/maintenance, great sound system (cool seeing your ipod tunes integrated into the audio system), the latest technology and something you won't pull up next to 5 of at the local supermarket.
* Get one....it's worth it!Between my wife and I, we have owned every BMW except a Z and this vehicle is by far the most fun to drive.
* I got Black Sapphire on Black...loaded...The X6 3.5i has lots of power, is good looking (a real head turner), rides like a car, sportiness of a coupe, and utility of an SUV.
* Fun to drive, great to look at, and plenty of room to haul home swap meet and mall purchases.I waited for one year to upgrade my car X5 to X6.
"
496,2009,ford,flex,5.5,3.7,66,53,"* Cargo area (rear seats folded down) carpet not greatThis is a must ....We love our Flex,,,This car is smooth driving and great in handling not to mention how much room it has on the inside...Leaving for vacation in 2 weeks and we are really looking forward taking the Flex with all the room in it for 5 people we will all be very comfortable for the ride.Wrote my first review 11/08 when Flex was first purchased.
* It doesn't handle like a large vehicle which is why it is becoming the favorite car to drive even when we don't have the kids with us.
* Overall I love the car but would like to see Ford put a little more effort in the quality of the interior and craftsmanship.I love this automobile !!!
* To make a long story short, I tested over 11 crossovers/suv's from 4 manufacturers, and the Flex's ride, fit and finish, and style was the best!This car is great.Unique style,plenty of comfort, great on gas for a vehicle this size.
"
497,2009,mazda,cx-9,5.9,3.7,22,15,"* Maybe the best thing is that it's a big car, but doesn't look or drive like one.
* It's also a stylish looking vehicle and way more interesting than a minivan.Our search came down to a used 2008 Ford Edge or a new 2009 Mazda CX-9.
* The sport version of the CX9 is a great value, you get many standard features for your money.
* Much more fun to drive than the mini-van too.So far so good, but it has only been a month.
"
498,2009,chevrolet,hhr,7.0,3.6,23,10,"* I have a 35 mile drive to work on a fairly empty mountain road and most people would be afraid to ride with me the way I drive it [hey, that's why we buy the SS] and yet I still get about 25 MPG!
* I almost wish I would have gotten the Super Sport, but this engine is great.Go buy one--I'm in Florida though---no more Ohio snow!I bought my HHR in Jan 09 and am really happy with the vehicle.
* It's a fun machine to drive, plenty of power and great gas mileage.
* If you want to break away from status symbol land and just drive a fun car, you will be glad you picked this one.A fun car to drive at city and highway speeds.
"
499,2009,kia,spectra,6.7,3.7,14,7,"* Looking forward to my first long-distance RoadTrip in this car.Just purchased my first Kia and my first new car ever, drove it off the lot with 40 miles on the clock.
* Mechanically engineered well, great gas mileage (I averaged 34mpg the first weekend, 300 miles of mixed use), looks pretty decent parked next to a Nissan or Toyota.
* I will drive this car when I'm on call for work on the weekends rather than one of our beat up company vehicles.This is my very first car and I know I made a great choice.
* I never thought I would say this but so far this vehicle from Kia is a pleasure to drive.This was my first ever new off the show room floor car.
"
500,2009,hyundai,elantra_touring,6.7,3.6,33,16,"* Haven't had it out for a long trip yet, but for commuting and light hauling, this is a great size and a comfortable ride.got it for invoice dealer great as of now 30miles per gallon handles great rides nice seats good lots of interior room get sport package much better tires and sharp magsIt's been only one week, but I love it!
* The cargo space, dash controls, satellite radio, gas mileage, and most of all the safety features won me over.Lots of interior room for SUV owners like me looking for better gas mileage.
* The Touring also has great safety features.After a couple of very happy years driving my 2007 Elantra GLS, I was fairly certain I'd be just as pleased with the Elantra Touring.
* We bought a Mazda 3 5dr last year and between the two, the Mazda's a little more fun to drive - better handling and power, but the Hyundai is more comfortable on a long trip.Good fuel economy.
"
501,2009,mini,cooper_clubman,7.3,3.4,16,6,"* At 6'2"" I'm quite comfortable driving this car that makes heads turn.Fantastic car, runs best on premium gas though, this is a fun hi- performance car for reasonable money , has a 3 year full maintenance package included, and the final and 4th year warranty covers all the major components.... look this car is fun, fun, fun!
* I have liked mini's for a while but they were just not practical until now, I love the extra space, and once the seats are folded down its surprising how much you can get in there!!
* It's surprisingly roomy inside for a small car, We have a 4 yr old boy and it's perfect - thats why we opted for the clubman.
* I gotta admit, I do like the clubman better than the mini...feels more stable.
"
502,2009,kia,optima,5.8,3.7,11,8,"* I never thought I would buy a Kia but, I have to say they have come a long way.Before I purchased my Optima I had a 2008 Kia Spectra in which was a great car.
* Rides great, great gas mileage at 34 HW, low initial cost, low insurance premiums, sharp looking, great lines, best color combination (Ruby red, w/charcoal interior), turns heads everywhere I go.
* I am shocked at the power from the small V6, better gas mileage than my Honda, better warranty, and it was surprisingly inexpensive for the features.
* Great basic features, great styling, very roomy cabin and a great value.
"
503,2009,saturn,aura,5.6,3.5,9,7,"* The transmission ""slipped"" on my brand new 2009 Saturn Aura at 347 miles.
* We got an Aura XR-4, 6 speed automatic I think Saturn (GM) hit a home run with the Aura.
* I looked at the Malibu (I like the Aura's looks better),Altima, Jetta, Camry, Sonata (cheap feel) and Fusion (I would also have bought the Fusion if not for the $ GM saved me on a pull ahead program).
* After numerous calls, we learned that the Dealership that was to make the repairs had given up their Saturn line and switched to Mazda and couldn't repair our vehicle even if they received the ""part"".
"
504,2009,toyota,rav4,5.8,3.6,50,36,"* We were looking to get a little pizzaz in an otherwise functional vehicle  the RAV4 Sport 6 delivers.Here's some ""real world"" mileage figures: Brand new 2009 V6 Limited 4X4....took it on a trip to New Mexico and Arizona starting in Minnesota.
* It is cute in appearance, but I am very disappointed that I have to spend the next three years in this automobile.Best small SUV, Rav4 is easy to park, fun to drive, nice interior I loved the trunk space.Fun to drive, the V6 really has some kick, yet on the interstate the 5 speed automatic transmission gave great performance and great economy.
* This package takes the spare tire on the back away and includes run flat tires instead (Looks much better than the other models and new for 2009).This car has been getting 28 MPG with mixed city and highway driving.
* I am happy with the vehicle but it doesn't drive as I expected.My first SUV and it feels great, drives like a small sports car.
"
505,2009,toyota,camry,5.3,3.6,74,66,"* I got it in black with the 17"" rims and love the way it looks!I was debating between a Honda Civic and a Camry and decided on the Camry since we are expecting a child and roominess and the quiet ride of the Camry sold me on it.
* (I have the seat all the way up as high as it can go) I was also a bit disappointed with the finish of the car and the gas mileage...I am getting 22 mpg...less than with my old car...don't know why...Anyway..I do like it and would recommend it to someone else...a taller person maybe....Our Camry's tires needed replacing at 20,000 miles.
* After driving my Camry I can tell you that I am Toyota lover now and my teenagers will each receive one when the time is right.I purchased a 2009 Toyota Camry SE in March and will be trading it very soon.
* However, the fit and finish on the Camry is better.I recently bought a 2009 Toyota Camry due to the fact that I had a Tundra, and Expedition plus a Lexus  I needed a economical car, I chose the Camry!
"
506,2009,cadillac,cts,5.2,3.4,29,27,"* The Catera Touring Sedan (CTS) is a great buy in my opinion, and with the excellent service I've gotten so far from the dealership, Cadillac is one GM division that is making its' vehicles right.This CTS is a good as any car I have owned and I have had most of the luxury ones.
* It's vehicles like the CTS that are critical to GM's recovery.Expect this from your dealer and cadillac.
* This new CTS made it even less painful to get rid of my old (2006) CTS.
* This is my first upgrade into the luxury category and I was thinking of a Lexus until I drove my new CTS.
"
507,2009,infiniti,g37,6.5,3.6,44,24,"* It is a different drive but as a daily commuter way outclasses my old car.I test drove TL S-AWD, BMW 335 X drive, and G37 X. BMW 335 gave me the best driving experience in terms of acceleration, handling, brakes, and comfort.
* There is also a good 2 to 2.5 second delay between pedal mash and power to the wheels at highway speed.My first time I have Inifiniti G37 Coupe, it was fun to drive... a good horse power, but it's for sure not a gas friendly car, I have seen avg 14Mpg to max 20 Mpg, and the sport model type have a noisy tires until you get used to it.
* Overall, I am very pleased.Have it for the last 2 weeks  interior design, comfort and features are outstanding  I switched from a BMW 3 series and will take some time to adjust to the drive  but I think G37 comes close.I was looking for a pre-owned Lexus GS350 or M35x Infiniti but ran into trouble finding low mileage examples and the new ones were too expensive.
* One day while waiting to test drive a pre-owned M the sales rep suggested I test drive a new G. I did and it was love at first drive.
"
508,2009,dodge,avenger,7.1,3.4,12,5,"* I love it and plan taking good care of it.I bought this car for my wife but it is just a great car and fun to drive.
* The Avenger is fierce looking...great style!We bought this 2009 avenger new it had 103 miles on it.
* Engine gets the job done but you won't win any races.I bought this '09 Avenger SXT at the end of June.
* They rank it low on ""fun to drive, "" and they either didn't drive one or are stupid!

509,2009,toyota,yaris,5.3,3.6,32,28,"* I love my new Yaris, 5 door, white hatchback, I absolutely love it, it looks like a cute little toy, it runs awesome, the storage inside the car is awesome, cup holders, the storage behind the steering wheel is great.
* My gas mileage averages 38mpg with 70% highway, 30% city with conservative driving (no speeding).I've had my Yaris for six months now and I still love it.
* Try it, you'll like it:)After my research & comparison on Toyota Yaris & Honda fit, I decided to get Yaris because it wins in most category & fit my needs for daily use.
* It's a great second car backed by Toyota reliability!My wife owns a 2008 Ford Fusion and my Yaris rides as comfortable as the Fusion,with better gas mileage.
"
510,2009,bmw,1_series,4.7,3.4,9,10,"* You don't need the 135, wonderful fast car but overkill for DD.Fun car to drive...glad I went with the manual transmission..corners perfect and had up to 110mph with still pedal left...convertible has very good acoustics with top up...I'd buy it again and I looked and drove all of the competitors...buy it.This was my first convertible, and I couldn't have been happier.
* It's fun to drive, fast, and BEAUTIFUL to look at.This is my first BMW, and prior to this, I had hardly ever ridden in a BMW.
* BMW has treated us well so far, but we are headed back for a second try for the repair.Traded in my 2006 Black Nissan 350Z for a base 128i with comfort access since I needed the back seats and man, I can't stop driving it!!!
* The 135i!I had my eye on a 135 ever since the first time I heard they were cramming a 300HP I6 into a car that weighs as much as a Dodge Neon.
"
511,2009,chevrolet,traverse,6.0,3.6,55,37,"* I also favored this vehicle over the Highlander because (1) it seats 8, not 7  (2) it has greater cargo room, ESPECIALLY when the rear seat is up  and (3) the seats split 60/40 so that one can go on vacation, comfortably seat 5, & still have room for luggage.
* I appreciate the stability, smooth and comfortable ride, nice interior design, amenities the vehicle has to offer, room and the feeling of driving a safe vehicle for my family (and their friends).
* If you are like I was, and couldn't stand the fact you are driving a minivan, but needed the passenger capacity (I have a wife, five young kids, and a disabled live-in-mother-in-law), give this vehicle a test drive.
* GM seems to have put a lot of thought and quality into this vehicle and I just hope that it performs like this for many years to come.This SUV is an eye opener for what it delivers to it's driver.
"
512,2009,mazda,cx-7,6.2,3.7,10,6,"* Traded in a 2004 Mazda 6, wanted to go back to a SUV type vehicle but got the the best of both worlds with my CX-7 - drive's like a sports car with the upgraded comfort and appearance of a small SUV.
* Purchased my '09 CX-7 AWD Sport (w/Leather)in July for USD 23000 OTD (out the door) and showed to my cousin and next month he bought 2010 (no leather) but with more nicer interior and options for 21,000 OTD same dealer, which makes me little sad.
* I Drove all the competions SUV's that were in it's class, however, this was the best by far for money, performance and style and comfort.
* Overall the CX7 is worth the money and is fun to drive.Do not buy a Mazda CX-7 with AWD!
"
513,2009,bmw,3_series,4.9,3.4,34,36,"* Run flat tires not much of a bother.This is my 3rd BMW coupe and it is by far the best as it builds on what BMW does best - great performance without sacrificing everyday driveability and comfort.
* I use to drive an Audi 2.0T Quattro, and though the cars are not meant to be compared, I can say without a doubt that the BMW ride quality, performance and driving experience are considerably superior.
* Overall, I couldn't be happier!Traded up from a 2007 BMW 328 to 2009 BMW coupe with leather, sport package, and sport seats.
* It is incredibly fun to drive, looks great, and performs like a BMW should.
"
514,2009,chevrolet,aveo,4.5,3.6,9,11,"* But I loved the way it looked outside & especially inside its such a nice looking car, just doesn't run the way it's supposed to.I bought my 2009 LT sedan Aveo back in May before the cash for clunkers.
* I love the dark red with beige leatherette seats I finally got, but all the extra bells and whistles intimidate me, the car doesn't have much pickup when accelerating and there's some dings that I hear in the back that I have no idea where its coming.We were aiming for an econo-box that wouldn't need a major overhaul in the next 3 years(i.e.
* If anyone wants a compact car they should take a good look at a Aveo.I loved this car when I seen it, I loved the style and size/shape, I really wanted it in White with black leatherette interior seats but no extras, my salesman did his best to find one to no avail, he told me in a 500 mile radius from Rutherford, nj there was only 2 aveos with leatherette seats and both cars were loaded, oh well, not a big difference in price, my only concern from past experiences is, if it has a lot of extras, if they break u gotta fix them!
* My dad bought a mazda brand new in 1978 for $6700 hard to imagine 30 years later same price for better vehicle.Just purchased the '09 Aveo 5 w/ auto and air package.
"
515,2009,pontiac,vibe,5.5,3.5,62,50,"* Vibe is Toyota Matrix twin but COST LESS,has XM radio,floor mats,stability control,and onstar at no charge [these cost extra on Toyota]also has 5 year 100,000 mile warranty, gas mileage is 2 to 4 mpg better than promised 25city/31 highway, motor and automatic transmission are extremely smooth,easy to load and unload with rear seats down, comfortable smooth rideI traded my Impala for the Vibe and it has been a good choice.
* Safety first, if you feel safe it must be good.My previous vehicle was a 2005 Pontiac Vibe and did not have any problems with it whatsoever, however due to the new safety features, new look, and the excellent 2.4 L engine, I traded it in for a new 2009 Vibe GT.
* This toyota based car has reliability and same solid drive train I enjoyed with the Toyota Corolla that traded in.We drove mini-vans for years& didn't need 3rd.seat anymore.We looked at many small wagons & found the vibe superior for room for the price.Have averaged 33.4 MPG for 4200 miles- city&highway.Very quiet-no wind or road noise.Shifts smooth with plenty pep-cruises at 70 MPH with ease.Have not been back to dealer for any problems.Too bad GM is quitting one of the best cars they have had.I bought this car 5 months ago to replace an SUV so was not sure about sitting lower to the road.
* Although hard to find, get the 1.8 L engine w/the base model  you won't need the 2.4 L. If you can, go 1 step further & get the 5-Spd manual - better MPG, feel more power, and more fun to drive.I have the 1.8L with the automatic option.
"
516,2009,toyota,camry_hybrid,6.5,3.6,79,43,"* Seems related to air pressure in the tank.I love everything about my Camry Hybrid, so far the only issue has been the ""check engine"" light, but that was also an issue on 2002 Camry XLE and the trunk is too small, maybe can be improved in the future.Have had my new Camry hybrid for three weeks now and absolutely love it.
* I was getting between 34-42 MPG when I first got it, but that was being easy on the gas peddle, now, with much more aggressive driving, I'm getting 28-34 MPG.
* )My Camry Hybrid has been delivering better than the EPA estimate of 33 MPG city mileage at about 34-35 on the first three tanks of gas.
* This is an increase of 21 MPG over the van (17 MPG in same cycle).The 2009 Camry hybrid is my first Toyota.
"
517,2009,mazda,mazda3,6.1,3.7,33,21,"* The one major complaint - the horn sounds like something from a clown car.I bought this car a month ago and, am very happy I did, it's such a fun car to drive its pretty zippy and the interior is very nice it has a lot of features for the price, love the 17'' alloy wheels, and it feels very smooth on the road and highway.
* Dealer service was terrible on issues.just got a 09 mazda3 for my wife i love the design and the dash lights are cool the only thing that i really dont like is the miles per gallon it gets it only has 1100 miles on it not sure if these have a break in period or not other than that its a great carI recently purchased a Mazda 3 5 Door Sport after leasing a Honda Accord for the past three years.
* It's got great styling, good fuel economy, and is fun to drive.
* The car is a blast to drive but the 16in rims and tires make the car feel less responsive but otherwise it's a great car.Honestly, best looking interior car in its class - Civic has nothing on this.
"
518,2009,honda,fit,6.5,3.5,127,67,"* My fit is a EX version after 5 months of driving it i feel that I could get a better car for my money, the fit power is poor (and winth a/c on is worse), the engine noise in the cabin is loud, the plastic is to cheap, I don´t like it after 5 months,since I bought it, the dealer change 1 sun visor, 1 plastic cover on the floor, the center air vents because when you put the a/c on 3 or 4 it clouse, and the boring noises are on all over the car those that are form plastic to plastic.I purchased a Honda Fit Sport with the 5 speed manual gear box and overall it's a very solid car but I traded it in for the following reasons..
* I don't have a long commute or drive a lot as other Fit consumers do, but I still got this because I know Honda's are reliable, I like the new Fit's design and performance specs compared to the older versions and I wanted to be environmentally conscious.
* Love everything about ""Hissy"" including the mileage, great little stereo sound for a 4 speaker base, fun to drive 5 speed MT, rock solid handling and feel, all of the safety air bags surrounding both front and back seat occupants, the 10 cup holders (8 in the front, 2 in the back), the voluminous cavern for hauling with the rear seats in the ""magic"" down mode, and best of all, knowing that Honda has built a fantastic hatchback with big time reliability.
* The automatic felt much more sluggish for some reasonI downsized from a larger, more powerful vehicle, and while I love the functionality, gas mileage, and looks of the Fit, in the month and 1,600 miles I've had it, I haven't been able to get really comfortable in the driver's seat.
"
519,2009,jeep,compass,7.1,3.6,10,4,"* Great fuel mileage, comfortable, easy to clean, roomy, quiet, great interior and exterior look.
* The new lifetime warranty is the best!This vehicle is good on gas, has lots of room in side for the size of it and good on long trips.
* Complaints lodged against the 08 Compass have been rectified in 09: the interior has been redesigned and looks great, the additional noise dampening makes the vehicle ride quietly and the transmission is smooth.
* Overall, I'm very happy with this car.i have an 07 patriot ltd and i luv it, but this compass ltd is so much more fun to drive.
"
520,2009,saturn,vue,5.9,3.5,13,9,"* First tank city driving car mileage with some AC use is 19.86 MPG.We bought our '05 Vue new four years ago and when it came time for a new car we wanted nothing else.
* First drive was... 1) solid vehicle 2) impressive power 3) I like it 4) how much is this?
* Must say, great experience with dealership and they offer comp car washes and donuts.We shopped all over for a nice vehicle and we found the Saturn Vue V6.
* Will definitely purchase a Saturn again and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to buy a new SUVAlthough I'm a confirmed Honda guy, I decided to test drive the 2009 Saturn Vue XR -- what a surprise!
"
521,2009,toyota,corolla,5.1,3.6,116,110,"* I test drove the Sentra and Civic as well but the Corolla came out on top by far!Just bought the new 2009 corolla and am impressed with the leg room, and just took a highway trip to check gas mileage, and got 41.3 MPG with a automatic, Very impressive.
* It's great for the money - great on gas, great look - worth every penny!I bought my new 2008 Toyota Corolla S (red) a few days ago.
* And decided to try a Corolla (a guy I work with has a 2003 Corolla with 220,000 miles with no breakdowns), thats one reason I went with the Corolla , don't like the space ship look of the Civic si.
* Since it only cost 20 bucks to fill it up after driving all day, I will learn to like everything else about the car.The Corolla has some giddie up'n go and handles well for a little car, because I like to move it through traffic, I like to shift from lane to lane, I like to find my openings, I like to time it , I like to make my move, I like to beat those yellow lights.
"
522,2009,jeep,wrangler,5.3,3.6,24,21,"* You pretty much pay $20+ for a toy, a head Turner.. Every time I drive it (with softop down) I feel like I am on a safari or on a beach.. And with the unlimited after market options available there is always something new to spice up ur ride.. Its not been 2 months yet and I have already spent $1000+ on it....My wife and I are newlyweds, and we have never owned are own car before.
* It IS a Jeep tho, and do not expect sedan like ride or all the bells and whistles in the interior, but if you want a vehicle that goes anywhere, turns heads and is just more fun to drive than you thought you could have then a Jeep Wrangler maybe for you!
* I haven't taken it off roading yet but it is such a fun car to drive and ride around in especially if you live in a nice place like Arizona!Overall, pretty satisfied.
* I love the top down and really hope they never change the jeep look because it is one of the last American icons left.Like most reviewers I was always a very cautious car owner.
"
523,2009,ford,escape_hybrid,7.2,3.7,18,7,"* City driving is fantastic, electric motor up to 40mph 4 wheeel drive cuts mpg but I average 28 mpg for the 600 miles driven Best compliment of fuel efficiency, utility and lowered environmental impact of any vehicle made in the USA.
* This 2009 Ford Escape Hybrid Limited does that for me thus far, and is just plan fun to drive I'm still on my first tank of gas and getting to know the SYNC & NAV systems, but thus far I am really pleased.
* Other improvements include a much better tuned switch from gas to electric and the mileage is better (31 average in mixed driving and it is not yet broken in).I couldn't be happier with my new Escape Hybrid.
* Our one complaint is that the new recycled material seats are as hard as cement and will make driving long distances (one of the reasons we went with the FEH) a bit of a challenge.
"
524,2009,smart,fortwo,4.8,3.4,15,16,"* Other reviews said the car was noisy, but I didn't notice any excess noise.Old people have discovered this car, so it is not sold to youngsters only...People ask me if it gets 60 miles per gallon, and I respond it gets the best gas mileage of any non-hybrid sold in America...You can do a u-turn on a narrow 2 lane street,but don't try going fast over speed bumps...The Passion is loaded with standard equipment, including panorama roof,paddle shifters,auto air,electric windows/locks,and ABS/ stability control...
* I originally bought a blue with silver tridian coupe back in July... had issues with water retention in rear hatch...was given a cabriolet smart loaner during repairs...fell in love with convertible...immediately upgraded to a red with a black tridian convertible because of 1.2% APR financing promotion, despite $3000 depreciation for trade-in .
* The Smart is Amazingly roomy for two...It has enough space in back for a week's groceries...It has style,which is lacking in other economy cars...
* I had six requirements in buying a car, all of which were satisfied by this car: 1)buy new at less than 12 K, 2)increase in value rather than depreciate, 3)five star safety rating (and I saw the video of them smashing a smartcar into a brick wall at 70mph with virtually no damage to passenger compartment, 4)plenty of room on inside, especially head toom, 5) lots of pep, 6)good in snow, 7) good at high speed, 8)incredibly fun to drive.
"
525,2009,chrysler,aspen,6.4,3.3,9,5,"* Although it took a several weeks I can now appreciate the third row seating, almost 20 MPG and the engineering improvements over Jeep.I may keep this one a little longer than usual...We actually wanted to buy a Tahoe, Yukon or Expedition.
* With the tremendous incentives and willingness to deal right now, we purchased this vehicle for a price we simply could not pass up...FAR FAR below the MSRP.
* The new engine combo is slower off the line and the Hemi doesn't really kick in until high into freeway speeds, but the transition across the power band is smooth, and is fast enough.
* If you can find one, buy itVery good handling, quiet to drive, very nice interior finish.
"
526,2009,honda,pilot,6.5,3.5,101,55,"* I love it  love driving it  and because I like the vehicle so much, I can, almost, better deal with going to the pump to pay for unnecessarily high priced gas.After 15 years of mini vans, we finally have a ride I love to drive.
* Gas mileage has been decent for a vehicle of this type: 22 mpg on the trip with 5 adults + luggage  19 mpg mixed city/highway  16 mpg city-only driving  14.5 mpg city-only with poor driving habits.Handles great, sound system with the exl-res dvd system is fantastic because you get the 510 Watt premium sound system with it as opposed to dealer installed dvd system.
* I added every feature I could and I'm glad I did as Honda options are excellent.Looking for more space and knew I liked my mom's 2006 Pilot as well as Honda's great reputation.
* It's true that the interior materials are not as upscale as other Honda vehicles (compared to my wife's 07 CR-V or a new Accord), but it's not offensive at all & I like it just fine.
"
527,2009,honda,civic,4.8,3.5,82,89,"* My Civic only has about 700 miles on it (it's hard to rack up miles in the city), so I'm hoping once it's fully broken in the mpg will get a little better.
* Loved it unconditionally until it had 134 miles on the odometer, and shut off by itself in 5th gear at 50mph, kept on downshifting trying to get going again, got going again sputtering a little and with almost 300 miles being fine so far, I just need to trust it again, but, it is a blast to drive, no complaints on the goodyears, sticky enough, clutch pedal like butter, love the steering wheel, would just love some alloy rims, but, the price was right.This car is great.
* Can't be accused of telling a police offer I didn't know how fast I was going.We traded in a 2001 Caddy for my new Civic and find this car so much more fun to drive.
* It's fun to drive granted it's no civic Si but it is quick and agile.
"
528,2009,ford,f-150,5.8,3.7,30,22,"* recently traded my 2oo5 f150 king ranch in for 2009 same version , the 2005 had no problems but the gas mileage was only 13.5 to 14.5 non towing and 7 or 8 towing two horse trailer .the new truck is averaging 17.3 to 18.5 not towing and 11 to 12 towing.the interior is much more refined with darker red/brown leather that will show less wear and staining then older version.the hood design has been changed so one can see more hood in front which is now sculpted and more enjoyable to look out over.the interior is much more refined with a much nicer dash and center console and the rear seat area is cavernous.Love this truck.2009 F150 4x4 FX4 SC 5.4, with 3.73 rear locker, 145"" WB.
* I traded in my 05 F150 with only 20K miles for this truck, I didn't need a new truck because there was nothing wrong with my old truck,,,,,,, but I was so impressed with the quiet ride I bought it.Traded a Chevy for a new Ford.
* Love most things about the truck, but here's my beefs after 1,000 miles (Platinum Version)- I have a very bad back and initially thought the seats would be comfortable, but between the fact that the steering wheel is such a long reach once seat and pedals adjusted all the way to the floor, and because the top of the seat tilts forward, it is not comfortable at all for more than 5 minutes- to 99% of people, this would be no problem.
* It pulls a boat and trailer like its not even there and the large backseat makes it nice for 3 large adults to sit.Only have 2000 miles on the truck but so far we love it, power is adequate, 6sp trans is great, mpg is 17, brakes have good feel and stop well, steering is responsive.
"
529,2009,subaru,impreza,6.4,3.7,37,21,"* Even though it's not why I bought it, I can't help loving the Impreza's amazing cornering abilities  it turns any twisting road into a fun driving experience.Took the two week old Impreza on its first road trip.
* Was fun to drive when it was running properly, but trust me its not worth the hassle!I don't know where the EPA got their numbers from, I do mostly city driving and am averaging 28.5mpg on the first two tanks of gas, the motor isn't even broken in yet, I'm sure to get over 30mpg.
* It's got lots of spunk, gas mileage is decent so far, and just overall fun to drive because it holds the road and doesn't let go, even through rough roads under construction.
* It was a no-brainer and I couldn't be happier with the car.I knew this car would be fun to drive, but I didn't know that I would think it would be the funnest car I think I've ever even been in.
"
530,2009,nissan,altima,7.1,3.6,60,25,"* Only wish I could get the fog lights.My 2006 Honda Accord lease was up and I wouldn't lease another noisy Accord!After test driving the Mazda 6(uncomfortable seats,strange engine noise),Malibu(not a fun driving experience),Accord(still noisy),Audi 4(loose low speed steering),Acura TSX(slow acceleration,small back seat),Fusion(poor steering feel),I kept coming back to the Nissan Altima 2.5SL,with connection package !After 2000 miles,I'm very happy!The car rides very smoothly,great acceleration for a 4cyl,23-25mpg in city,very quiet,Bose stereo,Bluetooth,ipod jack,are wonderful!No problems!Just came off my second Acura TL lease and very pleased with the move to purchase the Altima.
* The accord is a little bigger, but the altima drives like it weighs nothing and the look of the altima surpasses the accord hands down.
* I was undecided between the Altima and the Malibu and after test driving both of these cars I fell in love with the Altima!
* I just bought a new Nissan 2.5S Altima - my advice, don't get one!
"
531,2009,toyota,venza,5.8,3.6,73,52,"* To date we really like our Venza and this car really has summed up our cars in the past, including Mercedes, Cadillacs, Infinitis, and yes...even a few sport cars.Having just retired and buying new cars for over 40 years, we were looking for something that would sum up all the cars we've had before...good ride and handling, fuel efficient, luxury, roominess up front as well as storage, looks beyond on the norm both inside and out, quality, and feeling good after long trips.
* I was looking at the new RX when this car was introduced and I fell in love with it the moment I drove it.Having just retired and buying new cars for over 40 years, we were looking for something that would sum up all the cars we've had before...good ride and handling, fuel efficient, luxury, roominess up front as well as storage, looks beyond on the norm both inside and out, quality, and feeling good after long trips.
* I had a Tacoma 4x4 for 11 years and the ride of this Venza cannot be compared to the ride of a truck and the 20"" wheels help to smooth out the ride.The Good News: if you are looking to buy this car, don't be swayed by the occasional bad review.I don't know what those people are thinking.You just can't please some of the people most of the time.
* People always ask me what it is, still don't really have an answer, it's so unique.I didn't mind the truck like ride, the constant shaking of my head up and down while I'm going down the road is what really bothered me.
"
532,2009,pontiac,g3,3.8,3.5,5,8,"* I fell like trading it in but would take too much of a hit.Its a great little car for the price, I haven't had it very long so I cant say to much but its turning out to be a fun car to drive.Just purchased with clunker deal.
* I see where someone said something about the road noise, I had an AVEO and that had a lot of road noise, the Pontiac G3 has way less road noise and a way better ride!
* Just a great car,American cars(Pontiac) is the way to Go,Quality,Value,Fun,....Pontiac is Quality for a Great Price!
* Its a good car for the price I haven't owned it very long so I cant say much but its turning out to be a fun little car What a fun car!
"
533,2009,chevrolet,tahoe,3.3,3.6,4,8,"* My gas mileage around town is 13-14 mpg and on the highway about 17-18 mpg  however, my driving style does not place much priority on gas mileage.This 3rd Tahoe for us and is the nicest family car we have ever owned.
* The dash looks very elegant, the seats are super comfortable, and the nav screen is easy to use, and the design of the whole truck is great.
* In mostly city driving, I get about 14.9 mpg, which is great because my old Denali only got about 11 mpgI've owned many cars and trucks, all American.
* Comfortable, quiet, and 19 to 20 miles per gallon using cruise control and driving in a sane manner.
"
534,2009,dodge,challenger,4.2,3.4,31,43,"* The Japanese can't design and make a car like a Challenger with this styling, power and performance, and at a great price.
* Everybody in town stop and ask about the car.I love my new Challenger it is a very well put together car I have the r/t version it has plenty of get up and go and handles very well lots of looks from people everyone with any kind of sport car wants to race haven't lost yet only dislike is the shift assist from 1 to 4 if you are not on the accelerator in 1st.
* On the street people stare at this car like they are watching a magic trick.I knew when I purchased the Challenger SRT8 in Hemi orange that I would get attention but I did not expect so much.
* The base MSRP, 09 Challenger is nice, but the dealers are still trying to sell them like the numbered SRT*8, 08's.
"
535,2009,dodge,ram_pickup_1500,5.4,3.4,45,38,"* I hope my driving days are much better!Desipte wanting to avoid a bankrupt company - I kept coming back to the Dodge Ram - it had by far the best ride, and the best vibe (love the rumble when you start it up).
* Well, after test driving the new Chevy Silverado and the Ford F- 150, my wife and I both agreed that the Dodge not only had the superior ride quality, handling, Power, and asethetics were all the best.
* I just got my new truck I have always been a dodge truck fan but this one it most comfortable smoothest dodge I have ever owned I highly recommend it.Purchased this truck in May 2009.
* Ride is great and even my Chevy loving 12 year old is now a Dodge fan!I recently switched from an 05 F150 King Ranch to the 09 Ram 1500 Laramie and haven't looked back.
"
536,2009,pontiac,g8,5.2,3.5,69,63,"* An aftermarket exhaust really wakes the beast and gives it a much more respectable tone.ive owned a lot of cars from GM, this has to be the best one yet, i owned a 05 pontiac bonneville GXP that was alright, at best, this cars handleing is great, the steering is perfect, suspension is perfect in cornering and just relaxing on the highway, brakes are great, great design inside and out, feels well built, the power from the V8 is endless, would like a little more of a louder exhaust note, and the window switches should be on the doors, but those small things dont really wreck a absolutly great carBought in Jan and love the ride and quick steering response.
* This car is truly amazing... Don't pass up the opportunity to get your hands on one of these cars before they are all gone.4 days and love it I can't get out of it, bought it brand new 2009 GT model.
* The best experience is driving this car around town and everyone looking at it because you don't see these cars everyday.. And the ride is very comfortable.I just purchased a 2009 Pontiac G8 with the 3.6L V-6 a couple of days ago, and I'm saddened that GM is killing Pontiac.
* Anyway, we like our White Hot G8 a lot  and, there aren't that many G8's on the road it seems and that's cool.

537,2009,nissan,murano,5.9,3.6,91,63,"* Let's see how well Nissan repairs it's cars.One vehicle that does it all, great, fun to drive as summer sports car, handles and rides like one, a sure footed winter SUV on snow or ice, the CVT is smooth, quiet as well as the overall interior, have LE with 20"" wheels, drives perfect down the road Traded in a 2005 Mazda 6 Wagon and considered the Subaru Outback, Hyundai Santa Fe, and Toyota Highlander also.
* !Just picked up 09 Murano LE...Got a great deal on Demo with 1300 miles ..Asking price was 37.437.00 , i got it for 31.000.00...It wasn't easy ..After 7 hrs at the dealership they finally agreed ..If you are buying a Murano you have to buy LE...Looks better, drives better...Can't say enough about this car...Fun to drive.
* well first of all im glad i got the murano 2009...my wife and i was planning to buy a hilander but we went to nissan first and that was it baby, never get the chance to test drive the toyota highlander..im very happy with this car.when im at work i cant wait to go home and drive...it drive so smothhhhhhhhhhhh interior is beauty i fell like im inside the airplane....Recently turned in our 2005 Murano.
* While the vehicle has so many great qualities, including a fantastic interior, comfortable seats, and great ergonomics, I wish I had taken a bit more of an extensive test drive in the vehicle I took home.
"
538,2009,suzuki,grand_vitara,5.8,3.5,7,5,"* I bought the GV because of terrible roads in the winter and the potholes that only seem to spread more and more as well as for off road and towing.Gas mileage is not bad at all, averaging 20 mpg so far.Take a look at it you will like it.I am glad we decided to buy this suv.
* Take one for a test drive before you count this vehicle out.A great engine, I like this suv, that´s all, it has a great price, and grat value.I had a bad experience with my second suzuki.
* Other than that, it's a decent car full of defects.With only 15K on the vehicle I can't say much about reliability, but they got everything right the first time.
* Back in the 90's I had a Geo Metro, and my wife had a Geo Tracker, both were very well made and reliable, so it was a natural to go to the Grand Vitara.
"
539,2009,mazda,mazda5,6.2,3.7,29,18,"* The bluetooth is simple and works well as well as all the other gadgets.The Mazda 5 is the MINI Van everyone wants to love, my wife and were shopping for a MINI van and we test drove the Mazda 5 3 times plus borrowed my mothers Mazda 5 for a week and found that the Van wobbles at highway speed causing motion sickness problems for the passengers.
* We were looking at everything from small hatchbacks like the Honda Fit and Toyota Matrix to full-size minivans such as the Odyssey and Sienna, but the Mazda5 seemed like the perfect fit for us: it has plenty of space for a small family (up to 2 kids easily  3 would be fine until you have to go for a long trip), it's relatively sporty and maneuverable, and it's much more fuel- efficient than minivans.
* We needed an alternative to my wife's Chevy Suburban that would fit the entire family, while getting decent gas mileage and being fun to drive.
* I wanted better gas mileage, and we didn't need quite as much space, but I didn't want to give up being able to carry extra people, or lots of stuff.
"
540,2009,nissan,frontier,7.3,3.6,19,7,"* There's only one Frontier.After considering a variety of cars to upgrade to from my previous vehicle, I chose the Frontier as it provided a high level of features, great build quality, and is very comfortable to drive both around the city and on long HWY hauls.
* Bottom line--check out the Frontiers before you purchase--you'll be glad you didI miss the fuel economy of my old 1993 Mazda B2200 but the smooth, quiet ride and great acceleration on the highway are so much better than the Mazda ever was and I got a great deal.
* It's 4Cy, king cab, power package, full bed I bought mine after a 3 month search, the guy at the dealership was great at finding my truck, and he gave me a great deal.
* Don't be fooled, you can't have someone in the back for any long period of time in King Cab Have just under 3,000 miles so far and just minor problems.
"
541,2009,mitsubishi,outlander,6.2,3.7,13,8,"* After looking for more than 1.5 yrs for a smaller SUV that didn't look like a woman's car I kept coming back to the Outlander.
* I love the ""sun and sound"" option, the rear door opening and ""tailgate"" and overall space for the ""stuff"" I cart around.
* Would buy another one!After a lot of research on Edmunds about the Outlander I decided to go to the dealership- after test driving the SE- I fell in love and the following week bought it (not NEEDING a new vehicle).
* All in all, great lil SUV.I wanted a small SUV for under $25k that excelled on looks, warranty, standard features, and Edmunds Editor's Rating.
"
542,2009,honda,odyssey,5.8,3.5,35,25,"* Nothing that bothers our family, but do take a long test drive with a mix of city and highway roads before purchasing any vehicle - don't assume you'll love it just because it's a Honda...A++++ , First ever Mini in my life, looked at Sienna & others stopped once I drove this one.
* Doesn't feel when you are driving a van, only when you see the space, it feels like a spaceship.Just purchased my first Honda and first minivan.
* There's no surprise that the Odyssey is 1 of the best selling mini-vans on the market today...Solid build quality, reliable, comfortable, and versatile...Fuel economy has averaged 22/23 mpg with 80% hwy/20% city driving.Previously owned a Toyota Sienna Van.
* Can't beat the price with the standard features that comes with this minivan while comparing with other vans...!I have 2,300 miles on my Odyssey and I get, in my estimation very poor gas mileage.
"
543,2009,mini,cooper,4.9,3.4,17,18,"* I saw a MINI probably 10 years ago, wanted one ever since-the night before picking up my MINI concerned I might not like it as well as I hoped -- on the ride home (2 hours from the dealership) I love it more than I could've imagined - - Fall in love with it every morning all over again on my 25 mile commute There's no comparison of the pep of this 4cyl to any American made 4cyl or quality of the overall car -I've driven GM vehicles for 35+ yrs before this car, I think I understand why GM is having finanical difficulties, ""sorry GM"" I didn't take the decision to buy foreign lightly buying US was instilled in me as a child, but unfortunatly I couldn't find anything even close made by US mfgThis is a drivers car, fast, fun and tossable.
* The editor is wrong, I drive my Mini aggressively and no matter what I do, in the city my gas mileage is 30gpm no other cat in this price range come even close to fun to drive and performances of Mini, Thank you BMW!!!!
* The exterior design is probably the worst thing about it, I don't think its bad but most of the people I ask say it looks like a clown car or some weird like that but I like it.I wanted safe but cute cool but with some get up and go and let me tell you I test drove a lot of cars in this price range and nothing even came close.
* If you want fun, reliable transportation, and great gas mileage: Buy a Mini-cooper S. If you don't like it, no problem you'll be able to seel it for almost as much as you paid.This car has a Nice go cart feel but I think there should be a little more power.
"
544,2009,nissan,maxima,5.0,3.6,54,54,"* The driving experience feels like you're in an F-14 cockpit and the exterior has the lines of a GS 400.2009 Maxima 3.5 SV with Premium and Technology package in Silver Color replaces my 2004 Maxima.
* If you like to drive, this is a great car!Just got my Tuscan Sun 2009 Maxima SV with Premium and Technology packages.
* I already owned a TL, so I didn't want to do that again -) The Maxima also does a great job at the little stuff like a strong A/C system, large glove box, great iPOD integration, large map and cup holders, and easy to read owners manual.
* Test drove approximately 10 cars and never really found that perfect fit of sports sedan, luxury, good looks and reliability for a great price until now.We traded in our 2007 Maxima for the 2009 SV model.
"
545,2009,kia,sportage,5.7,3.7,12,9,"* I was surprised and disappointed to find an ashtray, GPS space would be better.So far I absolutely love this vehicle, the only thing I don't like is the non- adjustable headrest, which can be uncomfortable on long drives...it's great on gas, the radio system is great...I love it!This is our third Kia, and, as per the other Kias that we owned, the quality, and dependability is there.I was very hesitant about buying a Kia, for I have not heard very good things about them in the past.
* Dealer said my car needs to adjust to my driving style...emmmm I do like this carafter inflated ford escape and toyota dealer sticker prices I purchased my first Kia , This SUV seems well constructed and tight, It handles well and is fund to drive and even with all the added options its cost is almost half that of the others.
* I read the reviews, I like the car, If you do not like the arm rest chec out chic.com We bought one and it looks and feels like it came with the car.
* High safety marks,amenities you find in much pricier vehicles, and a great warranty are just icing on the cake.Have had vehicle a little over a month and am very pleased, has plenty of power and good fuel economy.
"
546,2009,ford,mustang,5.7,3.7,12,9,"* For any Ford fan this new C5 generation is the one to own -- all the good looks of the older Mustang combined with a modern, 5 Speed AT!I wasn't looking for this car because of practically reasons of having a small child and winter driving but decided to take a chance and leased one.
* I decided on the Mustang for its looks, excellent ride quality, horsepower, blazingly fast acceleration in the 5-speed GT version I bought, and Ford had employee pricing on the car.
* Plenty of power, great exhaust note (compare it to the weak sound of a 380Z), comfortable GT500 seats, aggressive exterior styling, and with amenities like the super smooth Tremec 5 speed, the light touch hydraulic clutch, and the 500 watt Shaker stereo this car is a dream.
* all around, i would purchase it again, and love it thoThis is a very well built car indeed and gets looks everywhere I go, Its sporty , fast and who could ask for naything more for your moneyjust purchased my 2009 V6 convertible mustang.
"
547,2009,honda,accord,3.8,3.5,84,140,"* Previously had a Honda Accord back in 1986 which we loved, kept it until 212,000 miles so that's why we went back to a Honda.
* Unfortunately for Honda this will be the last Honda that we will buy.This is my third Accord and they seem to get better with each new model.It's hard to find manual transmission Accords these days, but I located an LX-P and jumped on it.
* After the fifth visit, the dealership admitted that Honda knows about this problem  apparently Honda has a Tech Line stating FRONT BRAKE SQUEAL and PREMATURE REAR PAD WEAR on 2008-09 Accord and Accord V6.
* Brush Metal Color on the exterior looks rich and Gray Leather in the Interior is a great contrast.The 2009 Honda Accord's interior quality, fit and finish can be easily confused with that of an Acura.
"
548,2009,jeep,liberty,5.7,3.6,8,6,"* !I have been a Toyota owner for several years, and my last one (2007) Camry needed a new transmission at 8k, new rims mine were defective, I also have a 07 liberty in the family, it has been great, no rattles etc, so I went to drive an 09 liberty it was very Nice, sunroof, u-connect stereo, select trac 2 4wd, I 'm sure gas mileage won't be as good as with the car, but its an suv, not the fastest but its not a slug, take your time enjoy the drive, because it does have a Nice ride, and with incentives and discounts I got $6500 off the sticker.
* Hopefully it will be as good as my other liberty in terms of reliability, go test drive one, their Nice.We only have 5,000 miles on it, but it's the most impressive, fun to drive vehicle my wife or I have ever owned.
* It's a buy recommendation for me..I have had this off road two times, once with 200 Jeep Wranglers, 3 liberties, and a few Cherokees during a large Jeep Jamboree.
* I have bought many new vehicles over the years and this is the first new vehicle I haven't had to return to the dealer for some sort of repair or adjustment.
"
549,2009,pontiac,g6,5.9,3.5,13,9,"* Why did I buy it, Classic exterior look, great engine,good deal for the money,and the fact that GM is GM, and I wanted to stay American with some style.I am currently renting this car.
* I normally drive an 2007 Audi a4 and given my A4 only cost me about 5k more then a new G6 GT it feels about 100% better in terms of interior quality, handling and overall build quality.
* Can't figure out why GM chose to drop the Pontiac line.This car is fun to drive.
* 31 mpg so far on a couple trips.Purchased new 2 months ago, 2 k miles so far, on dealer visit.
"
550,2009,volkswagen,gti,4.7,3.6,9,10,"* Fun, Fun, Fun 'til my wife takes the GTI away......... Oh, yea - don't forget the Launch Control.
* OK I have owned my 09 GTI for one week and find it not only a sharp and comfortable but great performer or run it smartly to get great gas mileage.
* Good power, no turbo lag, good handling, nice interior with lots of room, good fuel economy, and it feels & drives like a more expensive vehicle.
* Great compromise, handles like a sports car, fun to drive, gives us 4 doors and a little room in the back to carry stuff.
"
551,2009,volkswagen,routan,5.3,3.6,25,22,"* Cheaper than the T&C and Odyssey too.I get 400 miles already..its my first new car and Im so happy with mine..I get 2 kids and my mother..all of them cant be happier with our van..every thing is great..roomy..softh..strong..cool..good price..all the toys..blue tooth..sattelite radio..2 tv screens plus 1 radio/video screen..30gb hard disc..compatible with ipod..power doors..power seats..every thing..good cuality materials...what else u wants ?This was a great purchase, its the first care I purchase in a while since I have been leasing.
* A brand new design and German engineering shows everywhere, leaving odyssey and sienna out in the dust.my van gets only 12 mpg in town and that is driving the speed limit.it has missed a few gears when you down shift.Having 2 small kids, and the endless stuff that goes with them, i knew the days of non-mini van ownership were numbered.
* This is our 5th VW and we have nothing to say but excellent thing about them Compared to my 2006 Honda Odyssey EX-L, this is a great van!
* My wife and I have owned 6 VW's and we can definitely say it has that VW feel and drive to it.
"
552,2009,mitsubishi,lancer,5.4,3.7,38,33,"* The car is great the performance on it is extremely good for a 168 HP 4 cylinder (beat my gf's 08 mustang (it's automatic)) the fuel economy is far better than what it's rated at!
* The pro's are great handling, very sharp looking, great mpg, good power, and a very quiet interior.
* This car is definitely not cookie-cutter, you won't see it along with all the Camrys and Civics, it's unique all the way from it's exterior to it's features.
* It's an absolute dream to drive, a ton of fun and so packed with technology that it's like driving INSIDE a computer sometimes.
"
553,2009,volkswagen,cc,5.6,3.6,53,42,"* Trust me!I have had this car for 2 weeks now and cant tell you how deeply satisfied i feel, this is a car of my dream, i have been researching for 4 months before leasing one, CC is a true head turner,i have a friend who bought an 09 Mazda6 i Grand Touring about 6 months ago for 28G +3.5G for the reems, and i could not enjoy his envious stare more when he first saw my CC, and whoever sees our cars pays no attention to his vehicle, its so mush classier for only 28G, grate job VwI had posted a partially negative review below, in which I complained about my new CC's steering feel and response.
* Checked few options such as BMW 328/330, G35, Civic hatchback.... finally I was standing to buy G35, but then VW CC arrived and I responsible buyer I went to check cheaper option ~36k of G35 vs. ~31k of VW CC.
* ).I was originally looking at the Jetta SE then I saw the CC Sport on the dealers floor and decided that it was a no brainer that the CC was the one to buy.After purchasing by CC I had the ECU upgraded by APR.
* VW got this one right.I've been a VW driver for many years and when the CC came along it was love at first sight.
"
554,2009,scion,xd,6.1,3.9,27,17,"* The two finalists were the Scion and the Honda... the Honda dealers' attitude (that I didn't like) and the Scion's ""pure price"" with a nice set of standard features tipped the decision in favor of the Scion.
* The Toyota dealership was right next door so I ran over and test drove the xD and found it much more fun, plus it had just as many features and better gas mileage... and less expensive!
* The fit was close in all categories, but one test drive of the fit and you'll go running back to the XD ... the fit has no power.
* I am in love, the dog and husband are jealous.It is fun to drive, gets great gas mileage (43 mpg, first fill up) and hauls my wife, two labs and groceries with no problems.
"
555,2009,hyundai,elantra,5.7,3.6,26,20,"* It's not sporty or a head turner,but for me that's ok.My wife and I purchased the Elantra out of desperation because it was the last day of the Clunkers program, most dealers in our area had already stopped accepting trade-ins and our 89 BMW 735i was falling apart We test drove the Jetta, Civic, Sentra and Corolla but purchased the Elantra blindly because we really had no other choice as all dealer's inventories were fully depleted.
* I had a recent crash with my new car and you won't believe but as per the advertisements, the car truly provided 5 star rating and we had not a single scratch on our body...I thank Hyundai for providing such great security features...I will buy a new 2009 model in a month time...After only 3 weeks and 300 km of winter grid road travel, all 4 wheelwells and all 4 mudguards are damaged.
* Bottom line is the price I paid for this great car...sure saved me a lot to afford to go on long drives for vacations.I purchased a new 2009 Elantra SE, and I absolutely love it!
* The Elantra, by comparison, no longer just offers a cheap car at a cheap price, but it's a great car (by comparison) at an incredible price.
"
556,2009,mazda,rx-8,5.5,3.7,6,5,"* I hadn't planned on getting another car, but my 15 year old 3rd gen RX-7 was totaled almost a month ago :-(, And I KNEW the ""8"" couldn't match the 3rd gen's stellar performance since the ""8"" is 300-400 pounds heavier, about 110 less horsepower (I'd had some things done to my 3rd gen) and doesn't benefit from the 3rd gen's 50-some-odd better low end torque (compliments of that sequential twin turbo setup).
* I never got to drive an older model, but the R3 is so incredible at handling, I couldn't imagine a boring drive in any RX8.
* It's fun to drive and the bottom line is i just love it more than all other sports cars i had in the past (don't know why).I bought this car for my wife after her Stratus got totalled in a 7-car pile-up.
* if you're going to have a hot car you should drive it hard... and this car really isn't all that ""hot"".
"
557,2009,chevrolet,silverado_1500,8.1,3.6,17,4,"* 13000 miles in 3 months because I love to drive it.I purchased my Silverado in Jun 2009, I upgraded from the Chevy Avalanche, yes upgraded.
* The bluetooth is a nice feature but I would think it would hurt their OnStar sales.Some trucks did one thing better than the Silverado but none did everything as well.
* Hopefully it lasts me 200,000 and then I will be Chevy for life.I bought my 2009 Chevy Silverado Crew Cab WT with 4.8 V* for under $20K.
* used my ON Star (the truck wouldn't move) They did a diagnostic check and told me all was just fine.hmmm.Got it to a chevy dealer, instead of a new transmission they totally rebuilt the one that burned up.
"
558,2009,cadillac,cts-v,4.1,3.4,7,10,"* Can blow the doors off most anything on the road and the stealth factor kicks hindend.Please, do not buy the V. I enjoy driving around knowing that there are very few vehicles that can deliver the fun, speed, luxury, ride, and FANTASTIC Power, M-5's and the rest look great in my rear view mirror.
* I had my doubts with a American made car & it's quality.I wasn't sure I needed this much HP?
* How would you like to buy a 4 door, 110,000 ZR-1 with better seats and interior for 65-70,000?
* One built by Chevrolet ('77, L-82, 350/350 coupe) and one by Cadillac ('09, CTS-V, Touring Sedan).
"
559,2009,nissan,sentra,7.5,3.6,9,3,"* Before deciding for this car i drove the Mazdas 3 & 5, Toyota Yaris & Camry, a VW and the Nissan Versa but ultimately decided for this car because it's good mileage, driveability and specially comfort... the lines looks somewhat similar to a Lexus.I love my Sentra!
* Having an auxiliary input jack for my MP3, Trip computer with outside temp, distance to empty, and steering wheel mounted audio controls was just extra icing on the cake.Had A Jeep Grand Cherokee once that was under 36,000 miles and the transmission went out - the freeze Plugs went out and the final straw was when the windows would not go up - that was my turning point to buy a Toyota 4Runner or a Nissan Pathfinder - Thank You Jeep for forcing me to make the Move and Thank You Toyota for being more expensive.
* Torque right off the bat is good, you can feel it in the seats, once car is at the speed you want, rpm goes down low, and it's quiet, surprisingly quiet on the freeway for a small car.
* Aluminum rims would of been a nice touch- worth the extra$ if you can find one with it.I test drove Nissan Sentra and just fell in love with it.
"
560,2009,volkswagen,eos,4.6,3.6,12,14,"* I was concerned about buying a hardtop convertible, but I bought the EOS knowing how well VW builds cars.
* It's so much fun to drive, and gets great gas mileage.
* I was driving a VW passat earlier and wanted to get a convertible, SAAB, VOLVO and EOS was in my list.
* '09 DVD Nav is worth it too if you drive aAfter almost 3 months of owning a new EOS I am still happy with the functionality of the sunroof, it has good torque throughout the RPM range even compared with other turbo engines, it has very good speakers but lousy sound unit (premium) but the worst for me is how it drives.
"
561,2009,buick,enclave,5.2,3.5,27,25,"* In less than a month since taking delivery of my new 2009 Buick Enclave CXL AWD, and with less than 800 miles logged on the vehicle, my new car has been in for service three times for the same engine vibration problem.
* I hate to admit I am ever wrong but the Enclave is by far the better vehicle than the Lexus in every way after test driving both twice (I was really trying to convince myself that the Buick was worse the first time).
* Most of our disappointments are related to the fact that this vehicle doesn't have as much room as a minivan and is missing some of the interior accessories you would find in a van.This vehicle replaced a van that we really liked.
* I traded a Rendezvous for this and the Rendezvous was actually a sportier drive.We had a Ford Edge and we loved it , This vehicle is more expensive but the ride and interior are superior.The 0% financing is great.This car replaced a Lexus RX-300 and a Lexus sedan.
"
562,2009,volkswagen,tiguan,6.2,3.6,55,33,"* It seems like a quality car, handles like a much smaller car, and is just a pleasure to drive and use.
* Am impressive array of features on the SE 4MOTION, sports-type handling, great vroom on the pedal, comfortable surrounds AND VW of America's 0% financing make this perhaps the best deal in America.Wanted a GTI but rear seat room was just too small.
* People stop me all the time to ask about it!I traded my 2008 Nissan Rogue SL AWD ater 21K miles for this Tiguan SE 4motion because of the better features, ride, handling, acceleration, and build quality.The car is the best engineering product I have found in the market today for the money.
* Don't know what noir authentique is talking about with the ""cargo area is useless"" comment, but this is a compact with very Nice interior room for the passengers and I fit 9 full size cases of beer in the cargo area.I normally do not rate a vehicle until I have 30K+ miles on it but I just had to share my pleasure with this vehicle with you.
"
563,2009,bmw,x5,6.5,3.4,22,12,"* Otherwise, it's a great car that drives like a sports car and yet it's luxury all the way!Went from a 2001 BMW X5 to a BMW 330i and now back to a 2009 X5.
* I love driving my Ultimate Driving Machine it drives like a dream!Just picked up my ordered BMW X5 xDrive35d (diesel) that I had ordered back in August 2008.
* It is fun to drive and handles great like a true BMW even though it's a heavy vehicle.
* It's my wife's so don't get to drive it much, but I feel good to have my family travel in this solid vehicle.
"
564,2009,nissan,gt-r,4.7,3.6,7,8,"* The ride is not that harsh, the gear box is a MANUAL for all intense purposes and the shifts feel like a good manual transmission would feel.
* The underside makes it hard to get at the mechanicals, and the owner's manual is useless for the DIY'er - it reads like a BMW manual.
* Simply put, the best car I've ever owned and I did test drive the M3, M5 AMG SL63 and Z06 before buying.It's the complete package.
* I've had an S2000 for four years, and like a previous reviewer I really think it is more fun to drive.
"
565,2009,infiniti,fx35,5.7,3.6,31,23,"* The FX fit the bill to a T. The NAV works great (once I figured it out), around view cameras are wonderful, gas mileage is not bad for an SUV of this class, and it still works great for hauling the kids and groceries.
* It drives great (now the transmission is fixed), looks great, sounds great, and is priced great when compared to so called rivals.
* Between the climate controlled seats, key fob options, electronically controlled retractable mirrors, 360 degree view camera, Nav, reclining back seats, intelligent AWD, great ride, and unique looks, this car is the best!
* It has great handling like a sport sedan, the exterior and interior is of superb quality and overall drives great!
"
566,2009,acura,mdx,4.7,3.6,18,20,"* During the test drive, the dealer encourage me to take sharp highway on-ramps at 60 mpg - I could feel the outer wheels ""pushing"" the car away from the turn - the feeling was totally exhilarating - I kiteboard - the adrenaline rush from the SH AWD (when used aggressively) is comparable to what I feel when on water - I would have never imagined that to be possibleI researched this car for over 1 year before purchasing.
* Way better, than Mazda and American-made SUVs.I am very impressed with the handling and many electronic features of the MDX, but I am somewhat disappointed in some of the interior fit & finish, harshness/loudness of the engine, audio quality, complexity of the navigation system, and the dealer add-ons that should be standard in a $40K+ vehicle.Generally I buy cars based on my trust in a company.
* :) Test drove X5, Fx35/50, and GX470, somehow overall MDX gave me the best combo scores in handling, performance, luxury amenities, and reliability... not to mention the safety rating on this 300 HP beast...
* This car does have excellent road handling, overall I am happy!Even though I loved the features of the MDX, I was originally not planning on getting a premium SUV and my preference was the Mazda CX9.
"
567,2009,ford,edge,7.2,3.7,13,5,"* Styling is great - the interior is well built and simple but classy / refined - no overdone plastic wood - no rattles or excessive wind noises - I have the vista roof - just a great feel and view - it is just like the SRX roof - the Sync system for the phone is a 10 - clear - understands every word - still have not interfaced the ipod yet - I drive a lot 3/4 highway - 22+ MPG - use the overdrive button for getting off the highway - it will downshift - save brakes for the long run - I do 40K a yr - one negative for me is no manual shifting of the automatic.
* Test driven Murano, Venza, Rav4, Tiguan, & Pilot, none look as good as this sport model.I bought the Ford Edge based on looks, the Sync system, and Ford's recently emerging reputation for quality.
* In normal city driving it gets 13 to 14 MPG.Upgraded from 2000 Windstar.Love the car,love the vista roof and awesome audiofile stereo system,very fun to drive.sharp looking vehicle.Plenty of get up and go.I grew up with Ford trucks and station wagons.
* Roof was worth the trade off - so far very quite and firm but car like ride - I test drove them all and when I drove the Edge, SOLD!Cash for Clunkers combined with rebates and dealer discount, I could not be anymore happier with my purchase.

568,2009,subaru,forester,5.2,3.7,93,87,"* And lots of room.Have had my XT Limited for almost a month and couldn't be happier with it  I'm 6'4"" and was having trouble finding a small SUV that fit--RAV4 wasn't even close (knees jammed into the dash), CRV was tight on the right knee (and I've owned the 2 previous generation CRV's that were fine in that respect) and too slow  driver's seat in the Acura RDX was ok, but the passenger seat didn't go back as far and again jammed my knees into the dash--I'm not going to buy a car I can't ride in as a passenger.
* And just 2600 miles on it, on a long road trip, the cruise control just stopped working, the ""cruise control"" warning light started blinking, the ""traction control OFF"" light came on, and the ""check engine light"" came on - can't bring in until next week - heaven knows what is going on - still had 300 miles to get home with car loaded with kids and gear.Vehicle is only one week old, not sure how many miles will be put on during the first year's travel.
* I researched vehicles on the net and Subaru was the best vehicle, so I bought it.Looks great, controls well laid out, incredible visibility, love the panoramic sun roof, comfortable and feel safe, sticks to the road like glue, good storage capacity, fun to drive.
* They are a more substantial vehicle with many more standard feature details such as lighted vanity mirrors, bumper cover, cargo tray, cargo cover, fog lights, all weather package, etc, Outback has better seats, quieter ride, better handling, power drivers seat, better interior materials, more solid construction.
"
569,2009,chrysler,sebring,1.4,3.3,2,12,"* We find it very comfortable to drive.I have the hardtop, and I really have no complaints for the money you can't beat it, i am over 6ft tall try to find a convertible that you can stretch out in and be comfortable at my height i previously owned 2 passats and there is a huge quality of interior ,sheet metal,and paint difference, but having said that it is very appealing to look at and gets great reviewns from passengers and onlookers,just don't look for a tight german ride.the car does everything well enough and the top comes down,nothing better on a summer dayGreat little car for the money.
* If you are looking to buy American and get a good looking car that gets great gas mileage, look no further.
* The Sonota is such a better choiceSebring is a great car  rides nice, adequate power, nice looking interior, the light tan leather seats are wonderful!
* The warranty is unbelievable,life time on Engin and Transmition,gas mlg is more than great,the design is wonderful,I read some reviews suggested poor built quality,I don't know about that yet,the car is new now,but I am positive that many years to come will prove it's not true either.
"
570,2009,dodge,journey,5.4,3.4,81,69,"* At 8e years of age, I shouldn't have to put up with this.I purchased a journey r/t 1/09 and before it had 2500 miles i had to add motor oil, and had gear oil leaking on the exhaust, the sunglass holder fell apart, the remote start only works sometimes, the remote entry is the same, only when it doesn't work and you finally do get into the car the radio is changing cd's, it has been in the garage 5 separate times for days at times, the transmission doesn't shift down or doesn't shift up, there is a whining and clicking that is still there, the dvd's play on the dash along with the navigation screen at times,or doesn't work at all, we looked around at many other crossover type cars, and picked the wrong one, for this journey... take the bus...Took it on a 1000 mile trip to Florida first month.
* Good ride for an 8 hour trip.bought the first rt journey with everything but sunroof loved it so much i bought another one on march24 it is black rt with everything besides nav and sunroof got a great deal, dont know of any problems besides when we got the new one when we parked it smelled like something was burning i figured it was from them changing the oil, but i saw other reviews about burning smell and plus it did it again when we took it home and parked it but other than that if it doesnt catch on fire we love everything about it.I just bought AWD sxt Journey this past week.
* My ESP (stabilizer) keeps coming on and I am getting a message to change the oil already, I only have 2650 miles on the car.I knew it was a risk buying a brand new model but my husband insisted we buy this because the gas mileage was supposed to be decent-I really wanted a Jeep before we saw the Journey.It is a nice looking vehicle and when it runs properly its great but I am concerned that there will be more trips to the dealer than we expected.Our Dodge Journey has been fun to drive.
* then we get it back the air bag light came on, then we were back in the shop for another 6 weeks until they could figure out the problem, now at 19k miles the brakes an rotors have to be replaced, the dealership said that every 9k this is happening...calle the useless folks at Dodge headquarters, they advise that this is normal wear and tear...also there is smoke that comes out from under the hood, which i have been told is brake dust, and that my car is 'safe' to drive...Decent car but cant get fixed.
"
571,2009,volkswagen,jetta,5.7,3.6,98,75,"* Low price, great gas mileage, fun to drive, roomy, great build quality and love the huge sun roof.This is the first car I have owned that isn't American.
* Car looks great, has typical German Engineering, is a BLAST to drive, and gets great mileage so far (with only 2,500 miles, I'm getting 36 daily city/freeway and got 43 highway on a recent trip).
* Got 41.5 mpg for the first 500 miles and 43 mpg for the second 500 miles (mostly highway but some stop and go).
* We also have a Honda Civic Hybrid, and the VW is getting better mileage, and is much more fun to drive.I have found that the TDI is great on mileage.
"
572,2009,scion,xb,6.4,3.9,58,32,"* The 2.4 engine make the Scion get and go, economy of the car is really see at the low speeds, the automatic trans could use an additional gear, keeping the RPMs around 1.8k when on the highway and would make the Scion that much more economic for highway use, but with a tight engine I got 315 miles on the first out of town trip.
* The xB isn't the fastest, sportiest, or most luxurious car I've owned but it's pretty fun to drive, it handles well, and it has a comfortable ride whether I've been on road trips or just cruising around town.
* The gas mileage is 26 mpg city and 34 mpg highway, that's worth the purchase itself.From 16 MPG (Jeep) to 25 MPG city (xB), Oh my, what a relief in these days of inflated gas prices.
* Overall, I think it's a great value, good fuel economy, great handling, lots of interior space, and the guaranteed reliability of a Toyota (of course).
"
573,2009,hyundai,sonata,5.7,3.6,149,113,"* It's one of those few things in life that is too good to be true....but it is!Car looks like quality but after driving it a few months can see that I may have overpaid for what I got, Rides stiff (could be the SE model), tires had flat spots, some surprises and some disappointments--lots of storage spaces, vinyl inside doors, dash, seats scratch too easy, good head & leg room, Worst feature is the way all 4 doors unlock when car put into park (I got nervous at a gas station on a recent trip, I was getting my credit card out of my purse before exiting my car and realized some questionable guys nearby were ""checking me out"" and I wasn't safe with my back doors unlocked--gotta always remember to immediately re-lock the car when parking so no one jumps into backseat or side.When I decided on a Sonata it was after many hours of research and test drives.
* You can get the same features and performance for thousands less than on a Camry or Accord.After driving all the other brands... for the price we just couldn't beat the 2009 Sonata SE(stickered at 22945 paid 17545 w/cash for clunkers out the door for 13045 w/o tax) the Sonata has more standard convenience features then any model that we drove, after a 1000 mile trip we averaged 32mpg and I don't miss a V6 at all, plenty of power from the 2.4 engine.
* Here is my first impression from my first 200 miles: The good: - great value ( can't beat 14,975$ price) - good interior ( dual color comes with cherry read color) - solid build quality - good fuel economy (200 miles on less than 1/2 tank) - manual tranny is Ok, except the clutch bites too soon The bad: - very soft suspension and numb steering feel - seat is too soft, no adjustable lumbar support or telescope steering wheel for GLS trim The Ugly: - SE trim would probably address most of my complaints but Hyundai simply doesn't manufacture SE I-4 despite the fact it is listed even in their brochure.
* I've gotten compliments from, literally, everyone who's been in my car.I am very pleased with the limited v6 the handling is very good hyundai did a excellent job with the 09 sonta limited those that have the models that are under the limited should have test drove the limited you would have been sold on it this car is very well put together with a very good ride and excellent gas mileage i am a premium gas man and my mileage is 32 on the hwy nothing to complain about this excellent car Purchased for size, economy, manual option and warranty.
"
574,2009,chevrolet,cobalt,5.5,3.6,24,20,"* I did not test drive other brands, so I don't know how this one would compare but with gm rebates/incentives it's a good buy, good acceleration, good ride and fairly quiet, with auto trans.
* The car is a pleasant surprise with all it's features, conveniences and style.I bought my SS Cobalt without driving one as every state west of the Mississipi had only 5 SS'.
* Its not the most exciting car to drive, but that's not why I bought it.The cobalt SS is one powerful piece of machinery.
* I get a combined 28.5 mpg with the car and I don't drive conservatively.I recently traded my 2003 Ford Explorer for the 2009 Chevy Cobalt LT XFE 4-door sedan, in sport red, with a manual 5 speed transmission.
"
575,2009,mercedes-benz,m-class,4.7,3.6,16,18,"* This MB beat my previous luxury Japanese SUV hands down, in terms of ride, braking, offroad (something the previous SUV just couldn't handle)and mileage.
* This MB beat my previous luxury Japanese SUV hands down, in terms of ride, braking, offroad (something the previous SUV just couldn't handle)and mileage.
* It feels like a Benz... That's the best part!Purchase this since we needed something relatively large - but were very concerned about getting a gas guzzler SUV.

"
576,2009,nissan,altima_hybrid,6.0,3.6,12,8,"* I have only owned for a short time but so far the Altima Hybrid performs well, has a quiet comfortable ride, gets good mileage (now averaging 31+mpg driving aggressive) , it seems to have good build quality/materials - I got convenience package only.
* First said it has ""learned"" my driving habits so it won't drive in EV the second claims EV does not work when the air conditioning is on (doesn't seem to work with it off) 6,000 miles on it and am ready to unload it.
* Overall, we could not be happier with the Altima because of its great performance and how fun it is to drive!I am a new owner and very pleased with first month of driving.
* While it doesn't get as good mileage as the Prius or Honda Civic Hybrid, it's much more enjoyable and comfortable to drive.
"
577,2009,nissan,rogue,4.9,3.6,27,28,"* I thought I would end up with the toyota rav 4 or honda crv, but there were things about each of them I didn't like..I didn't even know Nissan had the rogue model, and then I saw it in the paper one day, so I went to the dealer and drove the sl model, liked the features, the price was competitive, it felt more solid and quiet than the toyota and hondas I tried.
* And most of all, I love walking up to my car, admiring the sleek exterior, looking around, and getting excited all over again that I am the owner of the coolest looking car on the parking lot.My friend was interested in the Honda CRV but I convinced him to test drive the Rogue because I have been driving the same Nissan SUV for many years.
* I was first considering a CRV and even though I heard about the Rogue, I didn't think much about it until I saw an ad from Nissan, so I decided to test drive one.
* CVT takes some getting used to but overall I like it in the early goingAt first glance the rogue's didn't really appeal to me, maybe because I always seen a base model one (s) around town.
"
578,2009,lexus,rx_350,5.6,3.5,15,12,"* This car is based on the Toyota Highlander, which is a good vehicle to begin with  even though they both have Camry pedigrees, the car handles pretty good, and it was a bargain in contrast to other similar Lexus products.
* If you looking for a crossover that drives like a sports car, this will not be one to get, look at European rivals, MB, BMW.I purchased a 2009 RX 350 last month.
* Have no problem driving in sleet/snow/ice thus far.We bought a fully loaded 09 RX 350 FWD with the Mark Levinson sound system and navigation/bluetooth system.
* We got our new 2009 RX 350 in April, 2008 and the following week we went on a cruise, a wonderful cruise, but I could not wait to get home to my Lexus.
"
579,2009,chevrolet,impala,6.0,3.6,18,12,"* plus side is the interior is nice and there is plenty of room...other than that Chevy took a once awesome and fearsome car and turned it into the love boat.Even though I just bought an SS model I found it to be very comfortable and quiet during driving.
* The interior is beautiful, and the seats are really comfortable, I love my sun roof, and both of my boys have more than enough room in the back seat.
* It has plenty of power and easily will get 31+ MPG with sensible driving,The car is excellent for quality and price.Nice car - good power with nice interior overall.
* As for gas its good but you don't buy the ss model for gas mileage right.
"
580,2009,gmc,acadia,4.2,3.6,16,22,"* Just a quick update on our ownership expierience so far.We are happy with our Acadia and the nit picks are very few ( and minor ).I just put on the winter tires , Bridgestone Blizzaks ,fuel milage is getting better with more miles on the vehicle,great on long trips,kids love it,better sound system should be standard for the price,effortless to drive on the highway (120 km/h)very quiet inside.My wife, baby boy, and I shopped for our new vehicle for about a month.
* After driving them all, we found the Acadia to be the clear winner on all fronts: great & smooth ride for a large vehicle  super spacious  great gas mileage for this size of car (don't agree w/ other folks who are voicing their concerns about the true MPH?)
* Each time its on I take it in, and all 3 times they say its the emissions and each time I get one new part: canister with hoses, next time it was the purge valve, last time was the fuel tank sensor --and after the car was on the lift and the tank off -oops, wrong part, so I got a rental car at their expense.
* Great looks, good performance, great quality built, all round great car.The Acadia is fun to drive and comfortable on 3 long trips we have made.
"
581,2009,nissan,370z,6.2,3.6,24,15,"* When this happens, the car's engine RPM's are reduced from 7500 RPM's to 6500 RPM's, and if the engine oil temperature reaches 290 degrees, the engine's RPM's will be reduced to 4500 RPM's, which is approximately half of the 370Z Horsepower!My previous autos were an 08 TL TypeS, an 06 Vette, and an 05 Charger Daytona.
* ?I'm the previous owner of the following Z Car's: 1970 240Z, 1976 280Z, which I owned for 27 years, and did a complete restoration (frame off), 1990 300ZX, 2003 350Z, and now I've Just purchased a new 2009 370Z, which in my opinion, is the best Nissan Z Car that Nissan has made, by far!
* The car's engine must have an engine oil cooler, because it can't handle any extremely hot weather without loosing a large amount of engine power, dut to the oil temperature getting to HOT!
* I've had numerous contacts with Nissan's Consumer Affairs Department, regarding the 370Z Car's need of an ENGINE OIL COOLER.
"
582,2009,ford,ranger,4.8,3.7,10,11,"* Over all MPG, I'm pleased with the MPG I gotten on it.. On my first tank, I got 24mpg, I am near the ned of my second tank of gas, and I am around 28mpg as of now.Just bought the 2009 Ranger with 2.3 I- 4 and 5 speed automatic.
* Would not advise to buy.I bought a 2009 Ranger XLT supercab automatic w/ the 2.3 liter 4 cylinder w/AC power windows, & CD.
* Excellent price at less than $15K, acceptable acceleration, terrific fuel economy for a truck at 24 mpg average for 60/40 highway/city, and good build quality which Ford is now known for.
* My gas mileage is 20.5 around town and one one trip it was 23mpg.
"
583,2009,ford,focus,5.2,3.7,35,32,"* After a week driving a new Focus all over Washington State, I found the gas mileage to be very good (about 31 mpg overall), but the seats very uncomfortable, the handling poor, and the ride bouncy.
* Other than that Ford makes very reliable cars that get you where you want to go, treat them well and they will treat you well.Car is exactly what I paid for, SEL loaded for what it costs, as an ex 2007 BMW 3 series driver, more than surprised at the drive experience and standard equipment level.The car is great on gas I have been getting in city 30 to 35 and 41 to 45 in Hgy.
* The Focus?s cloth seats aren?t as nice, but you can get Focus heated leather heated seats for the same price as Civic cloth seats!
* Sync is good, stereo is good seats good, arm rest well placed at least for me (tall thin) seems the late model 09 have the trunk release inside and temp and compass.
"
584,2009,scion,tc,5.3,3.9,16,14,"* Very impressed with the tc I love the sound system and how quick it accelerates when you downshift I love the sunroof and the reclining back seats (even though I'm never in the back LOL) on thing I was a little disappointed on was the fuel economy for a 4 cylinder the fuel economy was not what I expected but all in all it is a great car.
* The material also picks really easy but other than that the car is great love itI just got my scion tc as a first car.
* Its been a few months since the problem and I love the car otherwise.I LOVE the Tc!
* Scion dealers are easy to work with too.Yeah so it's made for people younger than me (51) but I love my TC.
"
585,2009,infiniti,m35,6.4,3.6,7,4,"* I got the tech pkg, so I got the upgraded Bose system, but not the 5.1 system that comes with advanced tech pkg.
* The car rides great and is fun to drive, I got the Tech and Advanced Tech with Sport Packages.
* Although the Lexus was a little more ""cushy"" and had one or two more conveniences, this car is really the only other luxury vehicle that comes close in features, quality and value retention.
* The M35 is so much fun to drive and there is so much you can do while you are driving that it is a vehicle designed for efficiency.
"
586,2009,toyota,avalon,3.3,3.6,6,12,"* The 05 could attain 32 highway, and on our first road trip with only 300 miles on the car (added 240 more miles on the trip) we got 33.9 mpg generally driving 70 mph.
* This is a great car for long trip freeway driving.Just got the Toyota Avalon limited with cooled seats.
* After 4 months of driving it I am sorry I bought it.I first got into Toyota in my 2000 Avalon XLS.
* After driving around town and on an extended trip I have to say that the Avalon is probably the smoothest driving car I have ever driven.
"
587,2009,mazda,mazda6,5.5,3.7,83,67,"* I was looking at the Altima, Altima Hybrid, Camry and Accord and am glad I chose the Mazda6!I did most of my research online and only test drove a Mazda 3 then a Mazda 6.
* Don't know about fuel just yet, but I'm sure it will double my old Chevy, or was it a V6 Hummer:) Thanks MazdaDrove all the ""Camcordias"" - new 6 as comfortable as they are -you don't see it ""coming and going"" - to me that's one of the best features.
* With the incentives Mazda has right now and being a current Mazda Tribute owner I really couldn't resist getting a cool looking family sedan that get's good mileage and is very comfortable.
* I read all the reviews here and didn't even bother wasting my time with accord, camry or legacy(which is what I really wanted).I ended up getting the convenience and moonroof package...great car to drive and have fun everytime..I am no speed demon but I think the car has enough power for around the town and highway..I may be biased here, but definitely do not have one regret buying the 6..and not too mention that the salesman wasn't trying to strongarm the deal...Where to start?
"
588,2009,mercedes-benz,c-class,5.0,3.6,46,46,"* Love the car but wouldn't buy another one because of the cheap paint.I was all set to buy a BMW 3 series, as it comes with a free maintainence package, but my cousin who has a new C class took me for a test drive, and the result I bought one.
* Love the car but wouldn't buy another one because of the cheap paint.I was all set to buy a BMW 3 series, as it comes with a free maintainence package, but my cousin who has a new C class took me for a test drive, and the result I bought one.
* The package includes Premimum 2, Ipod connection, automatic transmission.The C350 shows sporty yet classic MB styling, is well crafted, has excellent power and torque, and is incredibly fun to drive.

"
589,2009,lexus,is_250,7.3,3.5,8,3,"* Interior lighting with LED accents is still state of the art.Before buying this I test drove a lot of vehicles, MB C class, BMW 335 and Infiniti, but IS has a different nice good taste to it, more stiff (in a good way) than MB, more stylish interior with same driving experience than BMW, more style than Infiniti (I think).
* maybe a I250/350L would be good?I was considering a BMW 328i which has a much sportier feel but when I compared the features of the IS 250 to BMW, Lexus proved to be a much better value.
* True, the IS isn't a BMW but the style, workmanship, navigation system and options are much better than what was available with BMW and I don't have to contend with the run flat tires that come standard with the 328i.
* Good handling, sexy exterior, luxury interior, good pick up.I leased a new Lexus IS 250 AWD after being told that the new model been updated for 2009.

590,2009,chrysler,town_and_country,6.0,3.3,21,14,"* love towne and country looked long and hard at honda ans toyota vans and keep looking for two years and reading the reviews about the thier better quality but in the end feel in love with the chrysler we love the chrysler features the limited has all the bells and whisles we are still learning in town milage is 18 but on the road we are getting 24.8 in the tennesse hills ride is wonderful very quiet do not like the steering respose in curves to much steering imput but overall we love the vehicle think the reviews are to critcal and pro japenese hope we like it in 5 years and 150000 miles when we buy again love love the optionsThis is a reliable and appealing car that I have had in my possession for over a year in which it has proven its worth.
* Includes dual screen video, myGIG, tri-zone air, remote start, heated front & 2nd row seats, power pedals, 6 power windows, dual sliding doors controlled by a button or the handle, stow & go, rear view camera, and more!Chrysler T&C minivan is a great mode of transportation.
* Leather, cruise, 2 dvd's, hard drive music, satellite radio, 3 zone temp, auto side and rear door, power windows all around (including side and vent) 6 speed trans, auto start, backup camera, power driver and passenger heated seats, and a good warranty all for under $27K.
* Better quality and quieter than ToyotaWe looked at Honda's and T&C's and for the money you just can't beat a T&C.
"
591,2009,nissan,versa,5.4,3.6,40,34,"* Needless to say, this was one of the worst cars I've bought, and I cant get rid of it because the resale value on the Nissan Versa and Nissan Sentra drop like a stone once you drive them off the lotThe Versa is by far the best sub-compact on the road.
* Excellent on gas and comfortable too.Traded in my old 1995 Nissan 4X4 king cab for the 2009 Versa 1.6 L sedan with ABS and AC (cash for clunkers) The Versa is very comfortable, quiet, and very peppy on the road.
* With the CARS program we got $4,650 for our 1985 dodge and the Versa S only cost us $9,550.I bought my 2009 Nissan Versa SL in May 09 to replace 07 Santa Fe truck.
* I came to own this car after my second used car died on me and felt that it was time to get a car with a dealer's warranty, and Nissan's bumper to bumper warranty caught my attention, and then the Versa I've read reviews where people have not exactly found this car to be particularly sporty, however, I must say I disagree.

592,2009,dodge,grand_caravan,5.2,3.4,16,15,"* If you are in the market for a van go check them out, you won't be sorryI've had my far share of Chrysler disasters and by far this is the best van i've ever owned!
* Last one owned was a 2006 and Dodge has cut corners on this new one compared to old-- plastic spoiler on back end, plastic bumper guard, etc.
* I would have preferred the styling of the Chrysler Town and Country, but this was better bargain because it came with so many extra features, including one I didn't especially want--the 3.8 engine.
* This van has much more to offer than its competition including stow and go seating better fuel efficiency larger more powerful engine better exterior appearance and the best warranty even if government backed.
"
593,2009,volkswagen,rabbit,6.0,3.6,18,12,"* Great performing and sounding engine, nice handling with perfect body roll, extremely solid feel on the highway, fun to drive, roomy, excellent safety features, decent (but not great) stereo, nice transmission, and generally good looks make it a winner.
* I picked the Rabbit over the Mazda 3 and Imprezza because it was more fun driving, cost less, and is supposed to get a little better mileage.
* It does not feel like a sub $20,000 car, nor does it drive like one.Just purchased brand new rabbit 2009 5 min after leaving dealership check engine light goes on when trying to merge on the highway car lost power pressing gas & car actually slowing down lasted almost a minute not long but very scary just the same.
* The Rabbit literally blows it away in the ""fun to drive"" category and comes with all the standard safety features that make the difference.
"
594,2009,gmc,sierra_1500,5.7,3.6,13,10,"* I looked at Ford, Toyota, Dodge and I kept going back to Gmc, I feel like I made a great choice.First new pickup in many years, always had a used one around, but primary vehicle has been SUV's until now.
* Great highway ride and good off road (but sits a little low) Handles ice and snow like dry pavement.
* Great power, awesome ride pretty good on gas im getting like 16 mpg right now.
* I like the trucks interior but I think I got a lemon I traded in a 03 Silverado on this truck I loved the silverado but this truck is wonderful, it's smooth as glass.I tow a boat and a camper with no problems.The interior is finally where it should be.Purchased the SLT Z71 with 5.3L, which replaced a 2007 SLE.
"
595,2009,lexus,es_350,6.7,3.5,10,5,"* The Mark Levinson Sound System is incredible.The 272 hp, 3.5 V6 liter engine rockets the Lexus ES 350 from zero to 60 in 6.8 seconds, better than the 2009 Mercedes Benz C300 Sport?s 228 hp 3.0 liter V6 (7.1 secs.)
* Great mileage- ave 22.9, standard stereo is excellent, very quiet ride, traded in 2005 ES 330 Lexus and the 2009 is ten times the car- excellent quality- worth every penny!!!
* Just bought a 2009 ES 350 - got a smoking good deal as the dealers are getting ready for the 2010's and want to move the 2009's out.
* Love the very quiet and smooth ride from the V6 272 HP engine.
"
596,2009,toyota,sienna,5.7,3.6,17,13,"* And the gas mileage is better on the new van than the 2007.After researching the Honda Odyssey and the Sienna, we decided on the Sienna.
* My two biggest complaints are the gas mileage (getting about 15 mpg which has some city, but mostly highway miles), and the side doors not stopping when something is in the way.I love my Sienna!
* All-in-all, a great vehicle and a great value.We just traded in our '03 Odyssey EX-L w/DVD for an '09 Sienna XLE w/ DVD & leather + xtras.
* Gas mileage not great.I purchased my new Sienna LE about two weeks ago.

* We love the diesels but gave up on VW ever getting the Passat diesel into North America.
* Our big gripe is that VW dropped Homelink from the Passat but not the Passat CC.
* Standard features, build quality and performance is something I would expect in a much higher end vehicle, The turbo makes the gas pedal like a hair trigger on a gun, the attention to detail and quality materials is far superior to this cars competition.

598,2009,dodge,charger,6.9,3.4,11,5,"* I bought this car knowing the gas mileage wasn't that great but after driving it I stopped caring.The car is GREAT to drive!!!
* Bought the 2009 R/T R package (Road and Track) - I think it is well worth the extra money - improved handling and the top line seats - only drawback they are (or at least at the time I bought) very hard to find.
* So far the car is great to drive - very comfortable on road trips - I can drive all day long.
* The car is a delight to drive and the 3.5L has more than enough power for my needs.I have driven Mopars for the past 20 years and the Charger is the best so far.
